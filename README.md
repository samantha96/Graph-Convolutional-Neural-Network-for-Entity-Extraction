Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Entity Extraction

Information Extraction (IE) is the process of extracting structured information from unstructured machine-readable documents 

# Data Processing
To feed GCN model and generate the neural network, we must provide three matrices.
N*N matrix represent the dependencies between words in a sentence
N*D matrix represent features of each word
N*E matrix represent class of each word
