Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Entity Extraction

Information Extraction (IE) is the process of extracting structured information from unstructured machine-readable documents 

# Data Processing
To feed GCN model and generate the neural network, we must provide three matrices.
1. the dependencies between words in a sentence
2. features of each word
3. class of each word
