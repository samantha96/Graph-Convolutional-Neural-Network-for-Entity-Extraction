1 EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb 
2 Peter Blackburn 
3 BRUSSELS 1996-08-22 
4 The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep 
5 Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer 
6 We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing 
7 He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union 
8 He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health 
9 Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE mad cow disease 
10 But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee mational animal health officials questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health 
11 Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers meeting of causing unjustified alarm through dangerous generalisation 
12 Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal 
13 The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials 
14 Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste 
15 British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe 
16 What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead Welsh National Farmers Union NFU chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio 
17 Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef 
18 Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year nearly half of total imports 
19 It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton some 10 percent of overall imports

21 LONDON 1996-08-22 
22 A rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S. guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $ 17,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions 
23 A Florida restaurant paid 10,925 pounds $ 16,935 for the draft of Ai n't no telling which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966 
24 At the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience where it was retrieved by a fan 
25 Buyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham who lived with him from 1966 to 1969 
26 They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060 pounds $ 7,845 
27 The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27

29 BEIJING 1996-08-22 
30 China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing 
31 Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities 
32 State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei Tang Shubei as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks 
33 Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks 
34 that is to end the state of hostility Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying 
35 The foreign ministry 's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan which Beijing considers a renegade province 
36 China which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien 
37 China says time right for Taiwan talks 
38 BEIJING 1996-08-22 
39 China has said it was time for political talks with Taiwan and that the rival island should take practical steps towards that goal

45 The figures represent a 13.6 percent increase for passenger cars and a 2.2 percent decline for trucks from July 1995 
46 Motor-bike registration rose 32.7 percent in the period

93 Israel plays down fears of war with Syria 
94 Colleen Siegel 
95 JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 
96 Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup 
97 Itamar Rabinovich who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight 
98 It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate 
99 The Syrians are confused they are definitely tense but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup he said 
100 Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador 
101 He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician 
102 Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message via Washington saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions 
103 But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere 
104 Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile 
105 It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes 
106 The message that we sent to Syrian President Hafez al- Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview 
107 Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war 
108 Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions 
109 Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February 
110 The voices coming out of Damascus are bad not good 
111 The media 
112 are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying 
113 this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners Levy said 
114 We expect from Syria if its face is to peace that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal he said 
115 We do not want a war God forbid 
116 No one benefits from wars 
117 Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a calming signal to Israel 
118 It gave no source for the report 
119 Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it 
120 The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo the United States and Moscow 
121 Polish diplomat denies nurses stranded in Libya 
122 TUNIS 1996-08-22 
123 A Polish diplomat on Thursday denied a Polish tabloid report this week that Libya was refusing exit visas to 100 Polish nurses trying to return home after working in the North African country 
124 This is not true 
125 Up to today we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will and we have not received any complaint the Polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in Tripoli Tadeusz Awdankiewicz told Reuters by telephone 
126 Poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate but Awdankiewicz said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries 
127 He said that there are an estimated 800 Polish nurses working in Libya

134 A spokesman for the group said the meeting signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions 
135 Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad 
136 Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan PUK group 
137 PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party KDP the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War 
138 Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a U.S.-sponsored ceasefire last year 
139 Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in Qasri region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days 
140 It said about 100 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack

156 Arafat had been scheduled to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday but the venue was changed to Gaza after Israel denied flight clearance to the Palestinian leader 's helicopters 
157 Palestinian officials accused right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to stop the Ramallah meeting by keeping Arafat grounded 
158 Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials on civilian affairs at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank 
159 Abu Rdainah said Arafat had decided against flying to the West Bank on Thursday after Israel lifted the ban because he had a busy schedule in Gaza and would not be free until Monday

161 JERUSALEM 1996-08-22

164 Palestinian officials said the Israeli government had barred Arafat from overflying Israel in a Palestinian helicopter to the West Bank in an attempt to bar the meeting with Peres 
165 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused opposition leader Peres who he defeated in May elections of trying to undermine his Likud government 's authority to conduct peace talks 
166 Afghan UAE embassy says Taleban guards going home 
167 Hilary Gush 
168 DUBAI 1996-08-22 
169 Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday 
170 Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry 
171 Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days an embassy official said 
172 The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland 
173 There is no objection to their travel he added 
174 The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan 
175 The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent possibly last Tuesday 
176 It has since been silent on the issue 
177 When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul the embassy official said That has not been decided but possibly Kandahar 
178 Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia 
179 Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government which Taleban is fighting to overthrow 
180 The embassy official said the three men believed to be in their 20s were currently in Abu Dhabi 
181 He did not elaborate 
182 The Russians working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan were taken hostage after a Taleban MiG-19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 1995 
183 Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani 's government 
184 Moscow said the crew 's nationality was coincidental 
185 Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed 
186 The Russians who said they overpowered the guards two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin 76 cargo plane last Friday left the UAE capital Abu Dhabi for home on Sunday

303 German farm ministry tells consumers to avoid British mutton 
304 BONN 1996-08-22 
305 Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals 
306 Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible consumers should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television 
307 I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers he added 
308 There are too many holes in what we know and these must be filled very quickly 
309 Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef 
310 The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified 
311 EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE mad cow disease 
312 But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health 
313 The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees 
314 Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste 
315 British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat 
316 ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year nearly half of total imports 
317 It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton some 10 percent of overall imports 
318 After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports 
319 EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease

630 TENNIS NEWCOMBE PONDERS HIS DAVIS CUP FUTURE 
631 SYDNEY 1996-08-22 
632 Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month 
633 The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia 's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split 
634 If we lose this one Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper 
635 Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 20-22 
636 Under Newcombe 's leadership Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year the first time the 26-time Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank 
637 Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 1994 Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche his former doubles partner has been three wins and three losses 
638 Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg Patrick Rafter Mark Philippoussis and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians 
639 The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one 
640 We are ready to fight to our last breath Australia must play at its absolute best to win said Newcombe who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain 
641 Australia last won the Davis Cup in 1986 but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser 's guidance

839 This was a big game 
840 The crowd was behind him and it was intense 
841 The shot brought home Ivan Rodriguez who had his second double of the game giving him 42 this season 41 as a catcher

851 Bonilla 's blast was the first time Randy Johnson last season 's Cy Young winner allowed a run in five relief appearances since coming off the disabled list on August 6 
852 Bonilla has 21 RBI and 15 runs in his last 20 games 
853 Baltimore has won seven of nine and 16 of its last 22 and cut the Yankees lead in the A.L. East to five games

866 Boston 's Mo Vaughn went 3-for-3 with a walk stole home for one of his three runs scored and collected his 116th RBI 
867 Scott Brosius homered and drove in two runs for the Athletics who have lost seven of their last nine games 
868 In Detroit Brad Ausmus 's three-run homer capped a four-run eighth and lifted the Tigers to a 7-4 victory over the reeling Chicago White Sox

870 The White Sox have lost six of their last eight games

1084 Garlic pills do n't lower cholesterol study finds 
1085 LONDON 1996-08-22 
1086 Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed British researchers have reported 
1087 A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets 
1088 The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels 
1089 They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets 
1090 There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians 
1091 Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period 
1092 The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate 
1093 Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol 
1094 But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short 
1095 The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets 
1096 The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol

1098 Britain gives aid to volcano-hit Caribbean island 
1099 LONDON 1996-08-22 
1100 Britain said on Thursday it would give 25 million pounds $ 39 million of development aid to the Caribbean island of Montserrat where much of the population living in the south has fled to avoid a volcano 
1101 The volcano in the Soufriere hills has erupted three times in the past 13 months and last April some 4,500 people living in the capital Plymouth and southern areas were evacuated to the north where many are living in public shelters and schools 
1102 This assistance will provide a fast track development programme for the designated northern safe area Britain 's Overseas Development Administration said in a statement 
1103 Britain gave 8.5 million pounds $ 13 million to Montserrat which is one of its dependent territories when the volcano first became active 
1104 Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker said a recent census had shown most Montserratians wanted to remain on the island 
1105 The development of the north will help them to do just that she said 
1106 Tennis Philippoussis looms for Sampras in U.S. Open 
1107 Bill Berkrot 
1108 NEW YORK 1996-08-22 
1109 World number one Pete Sampras seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year and women 's top seed Steffi Graf aiming for her third should be able to ease into the year 's final major which begins on Monday 
1110 Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia 
1111 Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round 
1112 Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January 
1113 Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks 
1114 While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 
1115 There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw 
1116 Bumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarter-finals but they could lock horns in the semis 
1117 Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round 
1118 Surprise second seed Michael Chang ranked third in the world opens against Czech Daniel Vacek while women 's second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim 
1119 Second-ranked Austrian Thomas Muster who was seeded third did not have the luck of the draw with him 
1120 In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late 
1121 If he survives Muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or 12th-seeded American Todd Martin in the quarter-finals in Chang 's half of the draw 
1122 Perhaps the best yet most unfortunate first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg 
1123 The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair 
1124 With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov who is nursing a rib injury in his path 
1125 Seles runner-up to Graf last year is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German Anke Huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents 
1126 But Huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked South African Amanda Coetzer 
1127 Sanchez Vicario runner-up to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis the 16th seed before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran Jana Novotna 
1128 Martinez begins play against Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania

1130 RTRS Tennis Muster upset Philippoussis wins Stoltenberg loses 
1131 TORONTO 1996-08-21 
1132 Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten 6-3 7-5 by 123rd-ranked Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 2 million Canadian Open 
1133 A lefthander with a strong serve Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds 
1134 The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten 6-7(3-7 6-4 6-4 by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden 
1135 Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa number four Marcelo Rios of Chile number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin the seventh seeed 
1136 Eighth seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland was eliminated in a one hour 55 minute battle by unseeded Mark Philippoussis of Australia 
1137 Philippoussis saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 8-6 
1138 Philippoussis 's compatriot 13th seed Jason Stoltenberg was not as fortunate 
1139 He held one match point at 9-8 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 5-7 7-6 7-1 7-6 13-11 by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic 
1140 I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do said Nestor who ranks 10th in doubles 
1141 There were only two service breaks in the match 
1142 The lanky Canadian broke Muster at 4-3 in the first set and 5-5 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long 
1143 I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match said Muster only partly joking 
1144 The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline 
1145 He played a good match took a few chances and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve 
1146 Playing at night was not Muster 's preference 
1147 I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match he said 
1148 I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference 
1149 Ivanisevic rallied from a 2-5 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44th-ranked Tillstrom who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon 
1150 Ivanisevic hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old Tillstrom 
1151 The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday made a quick getaway after his loss but did say Something was not there when I arrived in Toronto 
1152 I did n't feel good 
1153 And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles on Tuesday 
1154 I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes said Tillstrom 
1155 The 19-year-old Philippoussis who beat Sampras in the third round of this year 's Australian Open stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against Rosset 
1156 I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today but I fought really well he said 
1157 When I was down 2-5 in the tiebreak in the third set I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight 
1158 Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back

1180 Nigerian general takes over Liberia ECOMOG force 
1181 MONROVIA 1996-08-22 
1182 Nigerian Major General Sam Victor Malu took over on Thursday as commander of the ECOMOG peacekeeping force in Liberia two days after the start of the latest ceasefire in the six-year civil war 
1183 Malu replaced another Nigerian major general John Inienger who told officers at the handover ceremony that peace was now at hand for Liberia after six years of fighting and more than a dozen failed accords 
1184 The search for peace in Liberia has been difficult challenging and sometimes painful 
1185 Peacekeepers were harassed killed and taken hostage he said 
1186 It is difficult but I want to assure you that peace is in sight 
1187 United Nations military observers travelling to the western town of Tubmanburg on Wednesday to monitor the ceasefire were delayed by shooting along the highway U.N. special representative Anthony Nyakyi said 
1188 They finally went ahead with an escort from the ULIMO-J faction 
1189 Faction leaders who agreed a new peace deal in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Saturday have accused each other of breaking the ceasefire

1310 Former Surinam rebel leader held after shooting 
1311 PARAMARIBO Surinam 1996-08-21 
1312 Flamboyant former Surinamese rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk was in custody on Wednesday charged with attempted murder police said 
1313 Brunswijk turned himself into police after Freddy Pinas a Surinamese-born visitor from the Netherlands accused Brunswijk of trying to kill him on Sunday after a bar-room brawl in the small mining town of Moengo about 56 miles 90 km east of Paramaribo said police spokesman Ro Gajadhar 
1314 Pinas showing cuts and bruises on his face told reporters the former head of the feared Jungle Command had tried and failed to shoot him after Pinas objected to Brunswijk 's advances toward his wife 
1315 Pinas said Brunswijk then ordered his bodyguards to beat him up 
1316 Brunswijk 35 denied the charges and said he had merely defended himself when Pinas attacked him with a bottle 
1317 It was the second time Brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years 
1318 In 1994 he served two months in prison for shooting a thief in the buttocks 
1319 Brunswijk led a rebel group of about 1,000 in a 1986 uprising against the regime of military strongman Desi Bouterse 
1320 The conflict which killed more than 500 and caused thousands to flee to neighbouring French Guiana in the late 1980s eventually paved the way to democratic elections in 1991 
1321 Despite numerous problems with authorities Brunswijk went on to become a successful businessman with mining and logging interests

1339 Other issues affecting ties include plans by an Australian cabinet minister to visit Taiwan a security pact between Canberra and Washington and a possible visit to Australia next month by Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama 
1340 Downer is the first Australian minister to visit China since the new conservative government took office in Canberra in March 
1341 Palestinians accuse PA of banning books 
1342 NABLUS West Bank 1996-08-22 
1343 A West Bank bookseller charged on Thursday that the Palestinian Information Ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals 
1344 They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action 
1345 One official told me you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman Daoud Makkawi owner of the Nablus-based al-Risala bookshop told Reuters 
1346 He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said a prominent scholar at New York City 's Columbia University 
1347 Said a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord 
1348 On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said 's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals 
1349 Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the Palestinian Authority has no plans to censor books 
1350 There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever Taha told Reuters 
1351 But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials 
1352 This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers he said 
1353 Daoud said books by other authors including British Journalist Patrick Seale were also banned 
1354 He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books 
1355 I think this is a bad beginning 
1356 If we have confidence why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? 
1357 Daoud said 
1358 Thousands of books were banned from sale in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Israeli military authorities before the Jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the PLO under a self-rule deal in 1994 
1359 Egypt blames Istanbul control tower for accident 
1360 CAIRO 1996-08-22 
1361 The chairman of national carrier EgyptAir on Thursday blamed the control tower at Istanbul airport for the EgyptAir plane accident 
1362 Twenty people were injured on Wednesday when the EgyptAir Boeing 707 overshot the runway caught fire hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line 
1363 Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayyan told a news conference at Cairo airport The control tower should have allocated the plane another runway instead of the one the plane landed on 
1364 The one it landed on is 2,250 metres 2,460 yards long while the other one if more than 3,000 metres 3,300 yards long and is less steep he added 
1365 He said a Turkish civil aviation authority official had made the same point and he noted that a Turkish plane had a similar accident there in 1994 
1366 The EgyptAir pilot blamed Turkish airport staff for misleading him 
1367 The landing took place after a rainstorm 
1368 Its not an accident 
1369 It 's very wet 
1370 The brake action is very poor and the tower said it 's medium 
1371 That 's wrong the pilot told private Ihlas news agency in English 
1372 Egypt wants nothing to do with Sudanese rulers 
1373 CAIRO 1996-08-22 
1374 The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Thursday 
1375 Egypt says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year 
1376 It sponsored last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if Khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the Addis Ababa incident 
1377 The sanctions will come into effect in November if Sudan fails to extradite the men but Sudan says it cannot hand them over to Ethiopia for trial because they are not in Sudan 
1378 We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the Turabi front or whatever Mubarak told a group of academics 
1379 Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front the political force behind the Sudanese government 
1380 I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter 
1381 There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them Mubarak said 
1382 He did not say if Egypt would go so far as to break relations a step it has been reluctant to take ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese

1399 Miss Universe hides behind veil of silence

1401 LAS CRUCES N.M. 1996-08-22 
1402 Miss Universe Venezuela 's Alicia Machado left New Mexico on Thursday refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title 
1403 Machado 19 flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the New Mexico desert town of Las Cruces where she attended the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday 
1404 While Machado was not a contestant here she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. to drop 27 pounds 12 kg in two weeks or risk losing her crown 
1405 In Venezuela her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted 
1406 Marta Fajardo insisted her daughter who weighed 112 pounds 51 kg when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May had perfectly normal eating habits 
1407 Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy she said 
1408 Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her 
1409 Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant Machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage 
1410 Are you kidding ? 
1411 She 's fantastic said Nikki Campbell 28 who went to the pageant 
1412 She looked great 
1413 Very sexy 
1414 Machado 's publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in Los Angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to Venezuela on Sept 
1415 5 
1416 Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and Machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week 
1417 It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said Machado had been told to lose weight fast 
1418 People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat 
1419 Martin Brooks president of Miss Universe Inc said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her 
1420 She 's fine with it 
1421 She wished as we all did that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific 
1422 There 's no problem whatsoever he told Reuters 
1423 He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult 
1424 The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist 
1425 I dont know if Alicia is working out 
1426 We have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue he said

1450 Defiant U.S. neo-Nazi jailed by German court 
1451 Andrew Gray 
1452 HAMBURG Germany 1996-08-22 
1453 A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States 
1454 Lauck from Lincoln Nebraska yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred 
1455 The struggle will go on the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards 
1456 Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law 
1457 The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism 
1458 Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s 
1459 Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine honed during more than 20 years presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court 
1460 He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany 
1461 said Bertram who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as the greatest of all leaders and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth 
1462 Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 1994 
1463 He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence 
1464 Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books magazines videos and flags in his homeland 
1465 Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications 
1466 It is high time he was behind bars the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement 
1467 Lauck dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision 
1468 But as Lauck was about to be led away he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court 
1469 Neither the National Socialists Nazis nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen he shouted in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark 
1470 That 's the truth 
1471 His attorney Hans-Otto Sieg told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States 
1472 Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers Party Foreign Organisation NSDAP-AO which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party 
1473 During the three-month trial the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's NS Kampfruf National Socialist Battle Cry magazine filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews 
1474 The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities was illegal 
1475 Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations 
1476 He will probably be free in around two and a half years 
1477 The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term 
1478 UN official says Iraqi deal will occur soon 
1479 UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-22 
1480 A senior U.N. official said on Thursday he expected arrangements to implement the Iraqi oil-for-food deal could be completed quite soon 
1481 I am reluctant to speculate but we are doing the preparations and the secretary-general is anxious to start the program said Undersecretary-General Yasushi Akashi 
1482 It might be sooner than you think he told reporters after briefing the Security Council on arrangements for monitors needed to carry out the agreement 
1483 Akashi is head of the Department of Humanitarian affairs 
1484 His deputy earlier speculated at least 10 days 
1485 Suspected killers of bishop dead Algeria TV 
1486 PARIS 1996-08-22 
1487 Algerian security forces have shot dead three Moslem guerrillas suspected of killing a leading French bishop in western Algeria the Algerian state-run television said on Thursday 
1488 Security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain Moslem rebels the television said 
1489 The television which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the French Roman Catholic Bishop Pierre Claverie 
1490 The 58-year-old Claverie was killed in August 1 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western Algerian city of Oran hours after he met visiting French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in Algiers 
1491 An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against the Algerian government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists took a commanding lead

1526 Clinton 's Ballybunion fans invited to Chicago 
1527 DUBLIN 1996-08-22 
1528 U.S. President Bill Clinton had to drop the resort of Ballybunion from a whirlwind Irish tour last year 
1529 So Ballybunion is going to America instead 
1530 Two residents of the Atlantic resort where Clinton was to have played golf with the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring have been invited to the Democratic party convention in Chicago on August 26-29 
1531 They have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when Clinton addressed Ireland at a packed ceremony in Dublin city centre on December 1 last year 
1532 They read Ballybunion backs Clinton 
1533 The Democratic party have requested we bring our placards with us 
1534 We will be guests of the Kennedys said Frank Quilter one of the two who have been invited to Chicago 
1535 Clinton made a triumphant Irish tour to back a Northern Ireland peace process but was forced to drop Ballybunion from a packed schedule at the last minute 
1536 Bonn says Moscow has promised to observe ceasefire 
1537 BONN 1996-08-22 
1538 Germany said on Thursday it had received assurances from the Russian government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in Chechnya 
1539 Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said top Bonn diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger had been assured by senior Russian officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the Chechen capital of Grozny was not valid 
1540 The Russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it Erdmann told Reuters after speaking by telephone to Ischinger who had met the officials on a two-day visit to Moscow 
1541 He returned to Bonn on Thursday 
1542 Ischinger is the political director of Bonn 's foreign ministry 
1543 Ischinger said he met three Russian deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister who confirmed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov 's pledge that Moscow would seek a political solution under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE 
1544 The ultimatum to storm Grozny is no longer an issue he said quoting Ischinger who had been sent to Moscow by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as his personal envoy to urge an end to Moscow 's military campaign in the breakaway region 
1545 Ischinger said the threat of a major assault to take Grozny had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not Moscow 's intention 
1546 The officials had been positive about Kinkel 's request on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin 's security chief Alexander Lebed should on his return to Moscow meet Tim Goldiman the OSCE representative responsible for Chechnya he said 
1547 India says sees no arms race with China Pakistan 
1548 NEW DELHI 1996-08-22 
1549 India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China 
1550 Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India 's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China 
1551 I do n't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race he said 
1552 Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons particularly nuclear 
1553 China along with Britain France Russia and the United States is a declared nuclear power 
1554 India carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb 
1555 Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons 
1556 Gujral said he did not expect India 's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT to damage bilateral ties with other nations 
1557 I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country 
1558 The text has already been blocked he said 
1559 Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty particularly a clause providing for its entry into force was modified 
1560 Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly Gujral said That bridge I will cross when I come to it 
1561 In a written statement released at the news conference Gujral reiterated India 's objections to the treaty under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva 
1562 It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony the statement said 
1563 Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT 
1564 Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option he said adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 1974 
1565 He said We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security 
1566 Britain says death of its citizen will sour ties 
1567 DHAKA 1996-08-22 
1568 A British minister expressed his government 's official disquiet on Thursday at the recent death of a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin at Dhaka airport 
1569 I have told Bangladesh leaders that British goverment has attached serious importance to the resolution of the tragic death of Siraj Mia Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Liam Fox Fox told reporters 
1570 Siraj Mia died at Dhaka airport on May 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from London 
1571 His body bore multiple injuries and his relatives complained that he was murdered

1573 But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet 
1574 Fox who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on four-day visit said Britain wanted Dhaka to act seriously on the case 
1575 This is one of the reasons of my visit here 
1576 this is an important issue in our relationship said Fox who is due to leave for Nepal on Friday 
1577 Fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments 
1578 He said the Mia 's issue had been raised in the House of Commons 
1579 Fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in Dhaka 
1580 He said the Bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously 
1581 The British government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome he said 
1582 Fox said the British government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at Dhaka airport by customs officials 
1583 Bangladesh 's Criminal Investigation Department has charged two immigration officials in connection with Mia 's killing 
1584 Mia a father of five children had a restaurant business in a London suburb 
1585 India fears attempts to disrupt Kashmir polls 
1586 SRINAGAR India 1996-08-22 
1587 India 's Home interior Minister accused Pakistan on on Thursday of planning to disrupt state elections in troubled Jammu and Kashmir state 
1588 It seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections Inderjit Gupta told reporters in the state capital Srinagar 
1589 The local polls next month will be the first since 1987 in the state clamped under direct rule from New Delhi since 1990 
1590 India has often accused Pakistan of abetting militancy in the valley a charge Islamabad has always denied 
1591 Gupta said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the Kashmir valley to create disturbance in the region 
1592 We noticed among the people who come from across the border there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries Gupta said 
1593 India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the troubled region of Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 
1594 Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda 's centre-left government hopes the elections will help restore normality and democratic rule in Jammu and Kashmir where more than 20,000 people have died in insurgency-related violence since 1990 
1595 Over a dozen militant groups are fighting New Delhi 's rule in the state

1603 India RBI chief sees cut in cash reserve ratio 
1604 NEW DELHI 1996-08-22 
1605 The Reserve bank of India governor C. Rangarajan said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio CRR maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term 
1606 Over the medium term yes he told Reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital 
1607 He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary 
1608 He said he was only trying in that newspaper report to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply 
1609 Rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio 
1610 But in the current context the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time he said in response to a question

1616 Rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 16-17 percent annual growth in exports and a 14-15 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 20 percent over the next five years

1618 Mother Teresa devoted to world 's poor 
1619 CALCUTTA 1996-08-22 
1620 Mother Teresa known as the Saint of the Gutters won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor unwanted people with her simple message The poor must know that we love them 
1621 While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing God 's work 
1622 It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected she said 
1623 The poor do not need our sympathy and pity 
1624 They need our love and compassion 
1625 The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure 
1626 But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa who turns 86 next Tuesday was conscious and in stable condition 
1627 The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world 
1628 When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize she said characteristically I am unworthy 
1629 The world disagreed showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna or Jewel of India the country 's highest civilian award 
1630 Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker 
1631 A year later the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order 
1632 More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor 
1633 They could not agree so asked her to stay on 
1634 She agreed 
1635 In 1991 Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia 
1636 In 1993 she fell in Rome and broke three ribs 
1637 In August the same year while in New Delhi to receive yet another award she developed malaria complicated by her heart and lung problems 
1638 Last April she fractured her left collar bone 
1639 But her increasing frailty arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate 
1640 Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje in what was then Serbia on August 27 1910 
1641 She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 
1642 At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission 
1643 She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta 
1644 She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September 1946 
1645 The message was quite clear she told one interviewer 
1646 I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them 
1647 It was an order 
1648 I knew where I belonged 
1649 The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949 
1650 She took the name of Teresa after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus 
1651 In India she was simply called Mother 
1652 Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital 
1653 Named Nirmal Hriday Tender Heart it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying destitute people admitting nearly 18,000 a year 
1654 Her Missionaries of Charity a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad 
1655 In 1994 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of hyperbole and credulity 
1656 Catholics around the world rose to her defence 
1657 RTRS FOCUS-News forecasts alien-led profit boost 
1658 Bernard Hickey 
1659 SYDNEY 1996-08-22 
1660 Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday but forecast that the hit film Independence Day would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 
1661 From an earnings perspective the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture Independence Day News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 1996 
1662 It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year 
1663 A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable News Corp said 
1664 The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 
1665 News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion US$ 995 million and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents 
1666 Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion 
1667 The year just gone was disappointing but the outlook for the current year looks good First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said 
1668 News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations 
1669 Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard 
1670 Throughout the group higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million it said 
1671 News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs 
1672 Advertising revenues at The Times grew 20 percent 
1673 Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 
1674 News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide 
1675 News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation 
1676 It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper-Collins had not helped 
1677 The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out 
1678 But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement 
1679 If they 're saying at least 20 percent then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named 
1680 News Corp 's shares were down eight cents at A$ 6.39 at 2.00 p.m. 0400 GMT in a soft market

1683 RTRS Budget cuts to boost Australia savings RBA 
1684 CANBERRA 1996-08-22 
1685 The Australian government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings the Reserve Bank of Australia RBA said in its annual report 
1686 The government 's announced plans to balance the budget if realised would make a useful contribution to raising national savings the RBA said 
1687 The bank said there were concerns fiscal consolidation would unduly restrict growth but evidence was ambiguous 
1688 In its 1996/97 budget announced on Tuesday the Australian Coalition government announced an underlying budget deficit of A$ 5.65 billion and pledged to return the underlying budget balance to surplus by 1998/99 
1689 The budget deficit was A$ 10.3 billion in 1995/96 
1690 Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800 
1691 Determined and credible efforts to rein in unsustainable fiscal positions are often rewarded by rising confidence giving favourable effects on economic activity even in the short term it said 
1692 More generally the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates the RBA said

1706 WELLINGTON 1996-08-22 
1707 Power New Zealand said on Thursday that the Optimised Deprival Value ODV of its network at March 31 1996 has been set at $ 524.2 million an increase of eight percent on its $ 486.5 million valuation a year earlier 
1708 The company said the increase reflected the value of extensions to the network to meet economic growth in its supply area and an increase in the estimated lifespan of the network 
1709 It said the increase was consistent with the approach followed by other power companies and reflected the company 's new levels of preventative maintenance and equipment upgrading 
1710 The revaluation was undertaken to meet the disclosure

1800 Ukraine hails peace as marks five-year independence 
1801 Rostislav Khotin 
1802 KIEV 1996-08-23 
1803 Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement 
1804 Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 1991 backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow 
1805 Ukraine with a Russian community of 11 million people the world 's largest outside Russia has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya neighbouring Moldova and the former Soviet republics of Georgia Azerbaijan and Tajikistan 
1806 Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week 
1807 Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way 
1808 But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse although there are signs of a turnaround 
1809 Inflation a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow 
1810 Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that there was a turning point in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future 
1811 There is no doubt that economic growth has already started said Adelbert Knobl head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine 
1812 The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts 
1813 Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would definitely be introduced before the end of this year 
1814 It will replace the interim karbovanets currency which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble 
1815 Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems 
1816 Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public if unofficial visit 
1817 China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest 
1818 Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting 
1819 But Ukraine seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe is looking West as well as East 
1820 The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas 
1821 Relations with Russia which is our main partner have great importance Kuchma said 
1822 But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia even though those in some circles push us to do that 
1823 Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO 
1824 A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a stabilising factor in a united Europe 
1825 Oldest Albania book disappears from Vatican paper 
1826 TIRANA 1996-08-23 
1827 A 16th-century document the earliest complete example of written Albanian has disappeared from the Vatican archives an Albanian newspaper said on Friday 
1828 Gazeta Shqiptare said the Book of Mass by Gjon Buzuku dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in Rome was the first major document published in the Albanian language 
1829 We Albanians sons of Buzuku believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more lamented scholar Musa Hamiti told of the loss by the Vatican library 
1830 Tirana 's national library has three copies of the Book of Mass 
1831 There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies Gazeta Shqiptare said 
1832 Russia to clamp down on barter deals 
1833 MOSCOW 1996-08-23 
1834 Russian officials keen to cut capital flight will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum a customs official said on Friday 
1835 We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia Marina Volkova deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee told Reuters 
1836 Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals with nothing imported in return 
1837 She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 
1838 Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion she said 
1839 The cost of exported goods is too often understated so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher Volkova said 
1840 A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals and Volkova said this could substantially improve the situation 
1841 In line with the decree which will come into force on November 1 all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days 
1842 If traders are late they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods Volkova said 
1843 Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers but Volkova said the authorities are currently tackling the technicalities of the issue 
1844 Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus 
1845 A few years ago barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because thousands of trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems Volkova said 
1846 Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones 
1847 But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high she said

1850 LOS ANGELES 1996-08-22 
1851 Paramount Pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the Tom Cruise blockbuster Mission Impossible and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 Daily Variety reported in its Friday edition 
1852 The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening May 22 and $ 338 million overseas so far 
1853 It 's the biggest success for Viacom Inc-owned Paramount since 1994 's Forrest Gump 
1854 However many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible 
1855 Cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman who will write the script the report said 
1856 It said Mission Impossible director Brian De Palma would have first crack at the sequel though no deals have been made yet 
1857 Goldman whose Oscars were for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President 's Men earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters 
1858 However he singled out Mission Impossible as an especially entertaining movie Daily Variety said

1860 LONDON 1996-08-23 
1861 England batsman John Crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against Pakistan on Friday 
1862 Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 1415 local time 1315 GMT start in the event of no further rain 
1863 Crawley unbeaten on 94 overnight in an England total of 278 for six was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the Oval ground staff took centre stage 
1864 There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 1230 local time 1130 GMT 
1865 When brighter weather finally arrived the umpires announced a revised figure of 67 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 1900 local time 1800 GMT

1985 SOCCER SPONSORS CASH IN ON RAVANELLI 'S SHIRT DANCE 
1986 LONDON 1996-08-23 
1987 Middlesbrough 's Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is to wear his team sponsor 's name on the inside of his shirt so it can be seen when he scores 
1988 Every time he finds the net the grey-haired forward pulls his shirtfront over his head as he runs to salute the fans and Middlesbrough 's sponsors want to cash in on the spectacle 
1989 Having seen Ravanelli celebrate his goals 
1990 we thought it would be fun to have the name on the inside of his shirt a spokesman for the sponsors said 
1991 It will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest 
1992 Ravanelli aggravated a foot injury in the 1-0 defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday and was given only an even chance of playing at Nottingham Forest on Saturday by his manager Bryan Robson 
1993 TENNIS AUSTRALIANS ADVANCE AT CANADIAN OPEN 
1994 TORONTO 1996-08-22 
1995 It was Australia Day at the $ 2 million Canadian Open on Thursday as three Aussies reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories 
1996 Unseeded Patrick Rafter recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded American MaliVai Washington 6-2 6-1 in just 50 minutes 
1997 Todd Woodbridge who defeated Canadian Daniel Nestor 7-6 7-2 7-6 7-4 and Mark Philippoussis a 6-3 6-4 winner over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic also advanced and will meet in Friday 's quarter-finals 
1998 Third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated Tim Henman of Britain 6-4 6-4 after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden won his third-round match eliminating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-4 
1999 Ferreira and Enqvist play in a Friday night quarter-final 
2000 Two Americans seventh seed Todd Martin and unseeded Alex O'Brien will meet on Friday after winning matches on Thursday 
2001 Martin overcame Cedric Pioline of France 2-6 6-2 6-4 and O'Brien beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden 6-3 2-6 6-3 
2002 If you really look at the match said the 12th-ranked Washington after losing to the 70th-ranked Rafter I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net 
2003 He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my first service percentage was only in the 40s 
2004 Put those two things together and you get a loss 
2005 Rafter missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective 
2006 Before when I was on tour I always felt I had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time Rafter said 
2007 Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning 
2008 I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person 
2009 Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked Frenchman 
2010 It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set especially against someone you have never beaten he said 
2011 I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit 
2012 The 26-year-old O'Brien who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week has now won 18 of his last 20 matches dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July 
2013 He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago 
2014 I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week O'Brien said 
2015 But I 'm still competing well 
2016 I got a lot of first serves in said Enqvist about his victory over Korda 
2017 I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes 
2018 Still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday Enqvist joked Today against Petr there were about 64 strokes in the whole match 
2019 It was mostly short points

2042 JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-23 
2043 Centre Japie Mulder has been ruled out of South Africa 's team for the second test against New Zealand in Pretoria on Saturday 
2044 Mulder missed the first test in Durban with back spasms and failed a fitness check on Thursday 
2045 But new Springbok skipper Gary Teichmann has recovered from a bruised thigh and is ready to play coach Andre Markgraaff said 
2046 Mulder 's absence means that Northern Transvaal centre Andre Snyman should win his second cap alongside provincial colleague Danie van Schalkwyk 
2047 Wing Pieter Hendriks is expected to retain his place following speculation that Snyman would be picked out of position on the wing 
2048 The line-up would not be announced until shortly before the start Markgraaff said

2060 TENNIS INJURED CHANDA RUBIN OUT OF U.S. OPEN 
2061 NEW YORK 1996-08-23 
2062 Promising 10th-ranked American Chanda Rubin has pulled out of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships with a wrist injury tournament officials announced 
2063 The 20-year-old Rubin who was to be seeded 11th is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months 
2064 Rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport 
2065 Davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 17th-ranked Karina Habsudova of Slovakia 
2066 But as the highest-ranked non-seeded player in the tournament Habsudova will be moved into Rubin 's slot in the draw while Davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round according to U.S. Tennis Association officials 
2067 Rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 12th-ranked former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce and 20th-ranked Wimbledon semifinalist Meredith McGrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries 
2068 Men 's Australian Open champion Boris Becker will also miss the year 's final Grand Slam with a wrist injury

2238 Former world 800 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way finishing second in 2:29.66 
2239 But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd 
2240 Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break 
2241 In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record 
2242 The record of four minutes 12.56 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold 
2243 After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight taking her appearance money into account 
2244 Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface 
2245 Masterkova clearly enjoyed it 
2246 Mutola looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line

2285 ATHLETICS MITCHELL UPSTAGES TRIO OF OLYMPIC SPRINT CHAMPIONS 
2286 Adrian Warner 
2287 BRUSSELS 1996-08-23 
2288 American Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the Brussels grand prix 
2289 Sporting his customary bright green outfit the U.S. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of Canada 's reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey 1992 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis 
2290 Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week 
2291 The American who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey 's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration 
2292 The Canadian was second in 10.09 with Lewis third in 10.10 ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth 
2293 Christie competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting finished fifth in 10.14 
2294 Lewis making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race left the track with a slight limp 
2295 American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson 
2296 Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom 
2297 He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back 
2298 Jackson the only man to have run faster could not live with his speed taking second in 13.24 seconds 
2299 The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race 
2300 But Sweden 's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist who crashed out of last week 's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds 
2301 Olympic silver medallist Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 
2302 Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez 
2303 The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo Zurich Brussels and Berlin 
2304 Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 400 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 
2305 American Olympic champion Gail Devers clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 100 metres the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta 
2306 Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey who beat Devers in Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish had to settle for third place in 11.04 
2307 American world champion Gwen Torrence the bronze medallist in Atlanta was second in 11.00 
2308 It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot

2521 He will however have to do without the Dortmund trio of libero Matthias Sammer midfielder Steffen Freund and defender Rene Schneider who were all formally nominated despite being injured

2545 COLOMBO 1996-08-23 
2546 Sri Lanka and Australia agreed on Friday that relations between the two teams had healed since the Sri Lankans acrimonious tour last year 
2547 The Sri Lankans were first found guilty then cleared of ball tampering and off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was called for throwing during a controversial three-test series in Australia 
2548 Our concern is to get out there and play proper cricket Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga told a news conference on the eve of a warmup match between the World Cup champions and a World XI team scheduled for Saturday 
2549 What happened is history 
2550 Australian team manager Cam Battersby said he agreed with Ranatunga 
2551 I believe relations between the two teams will be excellent Batterby said 
2552 The Australians are making their first visit to the Indian Ocean island since boycotting a World Cup fixture in February after a terrorist bomb in Colombo 
2553 Australia have been promised the presence of commandos sniffer dogs and plainclothes policemen to ensure a limited overs tournament is trouble-free 
2554 The tournament starting on August 26 also includes India and Zimbabwe 
2555 Battersby said he was satisfied with the security arrangements 
2556 Sri Lankan officials said they expected heavy rain which washed out a warmup match on Friday should cease by Saturday 
2557 Australia led by wicketkeeper Ian Healy opened their short tour of Sri Lanka with a five-run win over the country 's youth team on Thursday 
2558 PRESS DIGEST ANGOLA AUG 23 
2559 LUANDA 1996-08-23 
2560 These are the leading stories in the Angolan press on Friday 
2561 Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy 
2562 JORNAL DE ANGOLA 
2563 The Angolan Chief of State addressed a letter to UN Security Council proposing dates for the conclusion of the peace process in Angola 
2564 He proposed definite dates August 25 for return of Unita generals to the joint army September 5 for the beginning of the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation

2632 Colombia U.S. reach aviation agreement 
2633 MIAMI 1996-08-23 
2634 The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota the Department of Transportation said Friday 
2635 Under the agreement which followed talks in Miami this week AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway 
2636 The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years 
2637 Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two Conditional status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program 
2638 Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved the department said 
2639 With the exception of the new services just agreed to the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years the agreement said 
2640 The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines Avianca and ACES

2691 Soccer Arab team breaks new ground in Israel 
2692 Ori Lewis 
2693 TAIBE Israel 1996-08-23 
2694 For the first time in Israeli history an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday 
2695 Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports a Pole and a Romanian 
2696 The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs 
2697 The club founded in 1961 has a loyal following in Taibe an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of Israel 
2698 But away from their home ground they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse 
2699 The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye 
2700 Two weeks ago Taibe coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek met Betar a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem 
2701 Chants from the crowd of Death to the Arabs and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw 
2702 One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium 
2703 We 're used to hearing the taunts of Death to the Arabs said Sameh Haj Yihye a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University 
2704 But we know that these are only words nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently 
2705 The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination 
2706 There are no parks or empty areas of land around here so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv 60 km 36 miles away Sameh Haj Yihye said 
2707 The town 's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks 
2708 We plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium but it may well be situated elsewhere said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye 
2709 We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year 
2710 In the meantime Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya 
2711 We are Israelis there is no question about that said Karem Haj Yihye a hotel waiter 
2712 We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians they live over there he said pointing to the West Bank seven km four miles to the east 
2713 We do n't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs said club chairman Abdul Rahman 
2714 We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit we are pleased at any support we get but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world 
2715 Soccer Kennedy and Phelan both out of Irish squad

2725 The other two teams in the group are last season 's Cup Winners Cup runners-up Rapid Vienna and Fenerbahce of Turkey 
2726 Juventus meet United in Turin on September 11 with the return match at Old Trafford on November 20 
2727 United have dominated the premier league in the 1990s winning three English championships in four years but have consistently failed in Europe crashing out of the European Cup to Galatasaray of Turkey and Spain 's Barcelona at their last two attempts 
2728 They have not lifted a European Trophy since 1991 when they beat Barcelona in the Cup Winners Cup final and their one and only European Cup triumph was way back in 1968 when they beat Benfica of Portugal 4-1 at Wembley 
2729 Juventus have won the European Cup twice 
2730 Before conquering Ajax last year they beat United 's big English rivals Liverpool in the ill-fated 1985 final in the Heysel stadium in Brussels

2810 Rana Sabbagh 
2811 AMMAN 1996-08-23 
2812 Jordan which has blamed Iraq for bread riots last week has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave official and diplomatic sources said on Friday 
2813 The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported 
2814 Adel Ibrahim the Iraqi embassy 's press attache was asked to leave because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms one source told Reuters implying he was accused of spying 
2815 Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he had not been notified of any explusion order 
2816 The government declined official comment 
2817 Ibrahim 's assistant Hussein Khalaf was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August 1995 
2818 Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan its only secure route to the rest of the world 
2819 Jordan has accused Iraq and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund 
2820 In Karak where two days of riots flared last Friday a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving shouting slogans for about 15 minutes 
2821 Disperse abstain from forming groups and help maintain order army officers who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots told the crowd through loudspeakers 
2822 The men shouted Allahu Akbar God is Greatest as a former Islamist deputy Ahmed Kafawin told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble 
2823 He had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises 
2824 Armoured cars had patrolled streets in Karak traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the 1950s and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers 
2825 There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of Amman where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on 
2826 The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party which has one deputy in the 80-seat lower house of parliament has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship 
2827 Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships

2842 He did not give a specific time for the ceasefire but said the United States looked forward to immediate implementation 
2843 The two party leaders had also agreed to meet U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau in September to solidify the cease-fire and to pursue reconciliation Davies said 
2844 His statement gave no venue or precise date for the meeting 
2845 The United States has already called on the Kurdish factions to hold peace talks in London 
2846 The KDP said Thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of PUK fighters killing wounding or capturing about 400 opposing guerrillas 
2847 The fighting has threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous Kurdish region in northern Iraq against President Saddam Hussein 
2848 One teen left dead by attack on U.S. slumber party 
2849 CHESAPEAKE Va 
2850 1996-08-23 
2851 A knife-wielding neighbour apparently intent on sexual assault invaded a teenage slumber party on Friday killing one girl and wounding three others police said 
2852 At about 4 a.m. EDT 0800 GMT a group of teenaged girls were having the overnight party in the Camelot subdivision of this eastern Virginia city when a man entered the house wielding a knife threatening to sexually assault the girls 
2853 Detective Richard Black of the Chesapeake Police Department said a neighbour Curtis Lee White II 19 was arrested in the attack but had not been charged by late morning on Friday 
2854 There were apparently no adults at the party as the father of the family who lived in the house was out of town and the mother died more than a year ago Black said 
2855 The detective said details were sketchy but two of the teenagers were reportedly downstairs watching television when White allegedly entered the house and told the girls to take off their clothes 
2856 He said a male teenager sleeping upstairs reportedly heard the commotion and came downstairs and confronted White who allegedly stabbed him more than once 
2857 The other teenagers also confronted the assailant and three girls all under 18 were stabbed one fatally 
2858 At least two of them were sexually molested Black said 
2859 He said all of the wounded teenagers were taken to a hospital but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening 
2860 Police said the girl who died was identified as Michelle Harper 
2861 Her age was not given

2912 Washington to curb Tamil support in U.S. Sri Lanka 
2913 COLOMBO 1996-08-23 
2914 Sri Lanka said on Friday the United States had promised to stamp out any illegal activities on U.S. soil directed against the island 's government 
2915 The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement The United States government sympathised with the current predicament Sri Lanka was facing

2919 U.S. embassy officials in Colombo were not immediately available to comment on the report 
2920 Colombo estimates more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels in the island 's north and east

2925 Foreign ministry officials gave no details of the issues the king who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani would discuss with Chinese leaders 
2926 The Himalayan kingdom sandwiched between China and India has traditionally sought to maintain close cooperation with its giant neighbours and an equal distance from the two 
2927 The 50-year old monarch was accompanied by Queen Aishwarya on a flight to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa

2936 OPTIONS Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall 
2937 LONDON 1996-08-23 
2938 Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates traders said 
2939 Volatility has come off a lot 
2940 We 're looking for it to stabilise now said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank 
2941 A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract 16.75 for December 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June 
2942 This compared with midweek levels before the welter of interest rate cuts of 18.50 for September 20.00 for December 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June he said 
2943 At 1347 GMT December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 two basis points down on the day 
2944 He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone which could offer value at current levels 
2945 He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end 
2946 The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent took markets by surprise 
2947 Volatility has a bid to it longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol he said 
2948 Long dated volatility has been low this year so it is still at levels which are not historically high 
2949 It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit 
2950 He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain 
2951 Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year Bunds it should be higher next Tuesday 
2952 He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy Spain and Sweden 
2953 Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential but a fall was not likely to be of significant size 
2954 I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets in Germany and France in particular 
2955 With high-yielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options 
2956 So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy Coughlan said ..

2968 Legal challenge to Diana delayed by jail term 
2969 LONDON 1996-08-23 
2970 A British photographer branded a stalker by Princess Diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage his lawyer said on Friday 
2971 Martin Stenning started a 12-week jail sentence on Thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by Diana banning him from coming within 300 metres yards of her 
2972 We were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the Princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks said Stenning 's lawyer Benedict Birnberg 
2973 But everything has been put on ice now 
2974 Birnberg told Reuters that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until Stenning was released 
2975 Stenning threw a brick through the window of a van in February after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider 
2976 Stenning who has previous convictions is expected to appeal against the sentence 
2977 Magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 182 pounds $ 282 
2978 The freelance photographer was branded a stalker by Diana whose divorce from heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles is due to become final next week after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle 
2979 In an affidavit the princess said that in chasing her Stenning had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera 
2980 Stenning has rejected Diana 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers

2994 PKK guerrillas would accompany the soldiers captured last spring in one of Turkey 's frequent cross-border drives until they could be handed over he said 
2995 Their release has been negotiated by Islamist writer Ismail Nacar as part of a wider effort partly backed by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan to find a political solution to Turkey 's Kurdish problem 
2996 Erbakan has encouraged Nacar 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels 
2997 The PKK often uses bases in northern Iraq in its fight for autonomy or independence in southeast Turkey 
2998 More than 20,000 people have died in 12 years of fighting between the guerrillas and Turkish forces

3009 Zenith lands $ 1 billion contract plans $ 100 million plant 
3010 Susan Nadeau 
3011 CHICAGO 1996-08-22 
3012 A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co 
3013 said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service 
3014 The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith which has struggled with years of losses 
3015 This really indicates we 're back in the business William Luehrs president of the Glenview Ill.-based company 's Networks Services Division said in a telephone interview 
3016 Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry 
3017 Following the announcement Zenith 's stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the New York Stock Exchange 
3018 The consortium called Americast said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment 
3019 In addition to Disney Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. BellSouth Corp. GTE Corp. and SBC Communications 
3020 Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television 
3021 Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in Woodridge Ill 
3022 to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets 
3023 The company currently buys the tubes from competitors 
3024 The new plant which is dependent on obtaining financing will create about 280 new jobs Zenith said 
3025 The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years 
3026 Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year 
3027 The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis 
3028 Zenith will convert its Chihuahua Mexico analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes 
3029 Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable 
3030 Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service 
3031 Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States 
3032 Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics 
3033 We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets for digital television he said 
3034 Although that is not where this particular contract is headed the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future 
3035 Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry reporting full-year losses since 1989 
3036 Last month it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million or 51 cents a share vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million or 97 cents a share a year earlier 
3037 Last November South Korea-based LG Electronics Inc. bought a majority stake in Zenith 
3038 Robert Gutenstein an analyst for Kalf Voorhis & Co 
3039 said the contract was not unique but it 's big 
3040 Digital is coming it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price 
3041 Natural Law Party says it can meditate problems away 
3042 WASHINGTON 1996-08-22 
3043 From the people who brought you hundreds of yogic fliers who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes The Natural Law Party a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday 
3044 At a hotel convention here the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation TM movement named physicist John Hagelin as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election 
3045 The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress crime terrorism and even wars 
3046 Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease said a party paper 
3047 Many party members are practitioners of TM which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase called a mantra 
3048 Some advanced TM followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly 
3049 But in a demonstration of yogic flying several years ago critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position 
3050 Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations 
3051 Martin Wolk 
3052 SEATTLE 1996-08-22 
3053 A year after its massively publicized introduction Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry 
3054 Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold making it the fastest-selling new software ever it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 1995 launch when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers 
3055 The Redmond Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme 
3056 But the product delivered eight months late has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers analysts said 
3057 It did n't do as well as it could have said Rob Enderle an analyst with Giga Information Group 
3058 Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized 
3059 People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed said Scott Winkler an analyst with Gartner Group 
3060 It 's not as though it has n't had an impact he said 
3061 It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for 
3062 Symantec Corp. which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections 
3063 Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch 
3064 Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products said Ann Stephens president of PC Data Inc 
3065 To be sure sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company 
3066 Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows now used on about 100 million computers worldwide 
3067 But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system 
3068 He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks 
3069 Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer Winkler said 
3070 Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed 
3071 But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 
3072 Windows 95 is going to do great he said 
3073 The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast sweeping change rather than a slow building change 
3074 U.S. says still committed to Cuba migration pacts 
3075 WASHINGTON 1996-08-22 
3076 The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally 
3077 A State Department statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that Washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents 
3078 The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies 
3079 The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally it said 
3080 Washington would also take prompt and effective law enforcement action against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba it added 
3081 Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits from Cuba to Florida 
3082 Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba 
3083 Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay a U.S. base on Cuba until they emigrated to another nation 
3084 The most recent hijacking last Friday involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft 
3085 Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but U.S. authorities planned to try the hijackers 
3086 In an incident on July 7 a Cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at Guantanamo Bay 
3087 Davies said he knew of no plans to return the man to Cuba 
3088 Wis 
3089 says is first state to apply for new welfare 
3090 CHICAGO 1996-08-22 
3091 In keeping with its pioneering image in the area of welfare Wisconsin was the first state to submit an administrative plan under the nation 's new welfare law Gov 
3092 Tommy Thompson said Thursday 
3093 According to a new release from the governor Wisconsin submitted a plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law Thursday 
3094 As the nation 's leader in welfare reform Wisconsin is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system Thompson said 
3095 Still the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program dubbed W-2 
3096 He said that despite the new law Wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents 
3097 The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children

3106 Jail better 
3107 Phan 's accidental journey started last week in Prince Rupert British Columbia where he was searching for a fishing job Jewell said

3114 LITTLE ROCK Ark 
3115 1996-08-22 
3116 State and federal agents on Thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black Arkansas churches that burned within minutes of one another late Tuesday and early Wednesday 
3117 Both churches were in the Mississippi delta region of Arkansas about 90 miles 145 kms southeast of Little Rock and were located within three miles of one another 
3118 We 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson but that has n't been conclusively established said Wayne Jordan a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police 
3119 Agents of the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms were also at the scene Jordan said 
3120 Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church and St. Matthews Missionary Baptist Church were both frame structures each near Turner Arkansas a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields 
3121 This is rural Arkansas 
3122 I 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here said Fannie Johnson a member of St. Matthew 's who said she believed arson was to blame 
3123 Others connected with the two churches said they shared that suspicion although all said they knew of no motive and no racial tension in the area 
3124 It 's sad someone would have that kind of spite in their heart said Rev. Jerome Turner pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church 
3125 Arkansas has been spared the loss of predominantly black churches to arson a wave that has claimed an estimated 30 houses of worship across the south in the past several months 
3126 A black church near Camden Arkansas about 100 miles 161 kms south of Little Rock burned in July but federal agents have not determined the cause

3149 AMSTERDAM 1996-08-23 
3150 Dutch post and telecoms group Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV 's Dutch PTT first half results came marginally below most analysts forecasts giving scant grounds to adjust full year estimates analysts said on Friday 
3151 PTT earlier announced an 8.5 percent rise in net profit for the first six months of 1996 to 1.209 billion guilders a hair 's breadth below the 1.210-1.236 billion forecast range 
3152 They were pretty much in line with our estimate of 1.210 billion said Peter Roe at Paribas in London 
3153 As we expected volume growth was quite good 
3154 there 's really no reason to change our forecast and our largely positive view on the stock 
3155 Coming just a million guilders under the forecast range is n't overwhelmingly surprising said ING analyst Steven Vrolijk who is continuing to look for a nine to 10 percent rise in 1996 earnings 
3156 They 've got a very sound domestic business which is doing very well we remain positive on the stock said Roe 
3157 We think it 's a solid performer in the Dutch market 
3158 Roe said he was sticking by his forecast of a 2.45 billion guilder net for 1996 
3159 Dutch PTT earlier on Friday repeated a forecast it would improve on 1995 's 2.26 billion guilder net profit for the whole year of 1996 
3160 By 1403 GMT the shares were down 1.70 guilders to 61.00 guilders falling in a weaker Amsterdam bourse

3198 Sea lion paparazzi to keep tabs on whales 
3199 LONDON 1996-08-22 
3200 U.S. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday 
3201 James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions natural companions of many species of whale can go where no man or woman has ever gone before 
3202 Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up Harvey told the magazine 
3203 That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do 
3204 The sea lions 17-year-old Beaver and nine-year-old Sake have undergone six years of training for their mission 
3205 Beaver once worked for the U.S. Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran 
3206 Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals filming it with a video camera 
3207 Their first assignment later this year will be documenting humpback whale migration off Monterey California 
3208 The article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups

3267 China copper stocks owned by state reserve trade 
3268 Lynne O'Donnell 
3269 HONG KONG 1996-08-23 
3270 Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve industry sources said on Friday 
3271 Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou where some of the strategic stockpile was stored they said 
3272 Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp CNIEC in June and July 
3273 It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission owned the copper 
3274 Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise 
3275 But one source the head of a Hong Kong trading house said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not 
3276 If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou it will be sitting there for years he said 
3277 Once it arrives in Yingkou it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders he said 
3278 Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months with traders unsure not only of who owns it but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it 
3279 Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange LME 
3280 A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price 
3281 CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously 
3282 Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year 
3283 This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs 
3284 Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market 
3285 Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics BME said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes whoever they are is the most important short-term fundamental in an already tight world market 
3286 BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals 
3287 Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement 
3288 Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses 
3289 They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases 
3290 They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market 
3291 But these concerns were irrelevant a Singapore trader said despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year 
3292 As with many commodities there is a desire by the Chinese government to keep a stockpile of the metal he said 
3293 You do n't keep it to help industry you keep it in case of emergency

3528 CRICKET ESSEX POISED TO STEP UP TITLE CHALLENGE 
3529 LONDON 1996-08-24 
3530 Essex are set to step up their English county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair Neil Williams and Mark Ilott sent Gloucestershire reeling on Saturday 
3531 Williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer Ilott also captured two as Gloucestershire 252 behind on first innings slumped to 27 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at Colchester 
3532 Essex who started the current round of matches in fifth place 20 points behind leaders Derbyshire with a game in hand could go top if they complete victory on Monday 's last day and other results favour them 
3533 Williams thrust Essex on course for success by dispatching Matt Windows and Andrew Symonds in his second over before Ilott removed Dominic Hewson and Tim Hancock to reduce Gloucestershire to 17 for four at one stage 
3534 The visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former England captain Graham Gooch when he added just six to his overnight 105 but Essex went on to make 532 for eight before declaring 
3535 Captain Paul Prichard plundered 88 from 73 deliveries hitting 15 fours and one six 
3536 Second-placed Kent were frustrated by rain which prevented any play at Cardiff where they have reached 255 for three in their first innings against Glamorgan while third-placed Surrey are facing an uphill task against Nottinghamshire 
3537 Surrey slipped to 88 for four in reply to Notts commanding first innings of 446 for nine declared at Trent Bridge before Alistair Brown struck a 55-ball half-century 
3538 Brown 's 56 not out containing eight fours and three sixes lifted Surrey to 128 for four on a rain-curtailed day 
3539 Fourth-placed Leicestershire had Hampshire on the ropes at Leicester before rain intervened 
3540 Pace trio David Millns 2-24 Gordon Parsons 3-20 and Vince Wells 2-19 had Hampshire reeling at 81 for seven in reply to the home county 's first innings of 353 
3541 Yorkshire rekindled their title hopes after three successive defeats by taking the upper hand against arch-rivals Lancashire at Old Trafford 
3542 Facing Yorkshire 's 529 for eight declared Lancashire were forced to follow on 206 behind after being bowled out for 323 paceman Darren Gough polishing off the innings with a burst of three wickets for one run in 17 deliveries 
3543 Lancashire then reached 210 for five at the close just four ahead after Neil Fairbrother hit 55 in 60 balls to add to his first innings of 86

3633 Newcastle 's early season teething problems continued on Saturday when they lost 2-1 at home to premier league pacesetters Sheffield Wednesday 
3634 England striker Alan Shearer gave Kevin Keegan 's talent-laden side the lead from the penalty spot after 13 minutes after Wednesday 's Yugoslav Dejan Stefanovic pulled down Colombian forward Faustino Asprilla 
3635 But two minutes later Wednesday equalised through Peter Atherton who found space in the penalty area to meet Mark Pembridge 's free kick with a precise glancing header 
3636 Guy Whittingham stole three points for the Yorkshire side with a goal 10 minutes from time 
3637 To add to Newcastle 's misery England striker Les Ferdinand was stretchered off in the second half 
3638 Wednesday who escaped relegation on the final day of last season have now won their first three games of the season

3903 AMSTERDAM 1996-08-24 
3904 Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen 
3905 Ajax who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock 
3906 Eight minutes after the interval Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net 
3907 Ajax without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise 
3908 But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar 
3909 The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday

4114 British hostage in Chechnya describes ordeal 
4115 LONDON 1996-08-24 
4116 A British aid worker held hostage in Chechnya for nearly four weeks said on Saturday a cocked Kalashnikov had been thrust into his mouth at one point during his ordeal 
4117 Michael Penrose a 23-year-old worker with the group Action Against Hunger described his ordeal to a news conference when he arrived back in Britain from Moscow 
4118 The worst period of physical manhandling was during that time when we were beaten with Kalashnikovs and at one point I had a Kalashnikov held to the back of my throat cocked he said 
4119 For the first period we were held in a small room with no bed or anything 
4120 We had very little food and sometimes went two or three days without eating 
4121 Gunmen seized Penrose who comes from Swerford in southern England Frenchman Frederic Malardeau and six other hostages from their car in Grozny the capital of Chechnya on July 27 
4122 The assailants had demanded a ransom of 300,000 pounds $ 465,000 but no money was paid by the charity when they were released on Wednesday 
4123 The hostages were held in a house in or near Grozny which was bombarded regularly 
4124 During the last 15 days of being held the fighting in Grozny was very close 
4125 At first it was street fighting outside the house and then we came under very heavy shelling and bombardment from conventional weapons like tanks artillery and grenade launchers he said 
4126 Penrose had been working for the charity which provides food to civilians for only a few weeks before he was captured 
4127 When asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting Russian troops for full independence Penrose said Not for the time being 
4128 I do n't think it 's safe for me 
4129 But maybe in the future depending on the circumstances

4188 HARARE 1996-08-24 
4189 The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights 
4190 The Public Service Commission PSC said in a statement that the workers including nurses junior doctors mortuary attendants customs officers and firefighters would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday 
4191 All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours and remained working for the full working day on 23 August 1996 have been summarily dismissed 
4192 with immediate effect it said in a statement 
4193 Union officials from the Public Service Association PSA were unavailable for comment 
4194 Public Service Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers sub-contracting some of the work to private firms 
4195 The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday saying it was illegal 
4196 But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met 
4197 The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the Red Cross 
4198 It has also disrupted flights 
4199 Some internal services were cancelled leaving tourists at the Victoria Falls resort stranded and flights abroad were delayed 
4200 The PSA said 80 percent of the country 's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe who has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980 
4201 Opposition parties civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government 's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers 
4202 Civil servants earn on average Z$ 1,000 $ 100 a month 
4203 They say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation currently running at 22 percent

4205 KIGALI 1996-08-24 
4206 Rwanda said on Saturday that Zaire had expelled 28 Rwandan Hutu refugees accused of being trouble-makers in camps in eastern Zaire 
4207 Captain Firmin Gatera spokesman for the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army told Reuters in Kigali that 17 of the 28 refugees handed over on Friday from the Zairean town of Goma had been soldiers in the former Hutu army which fled to Zaire in 1994 after being defeated by Tutsi forces in Rwanda 's civil war 
4208 Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Thursday in a visit to Rwanda that his country would expell all the refugees back to Rwanda but he gave no timeframe 
4209 Zaire is home to 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled three months of civil war in 1994 
4210 Many had taken part in the genocide that year of one million people mostly Tutsis and refuse to go home for fear of reprisal at the hands of the new Tutsi-dominated government in Kigali 
4211 Gatera said the refugees were handed over following a deal made at a meeting between the governor of Zaire 's north Kivu region and his counterpart in the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi 
4212 After a meeting between the governor of north Kivu and the prefect of Gisenyi 28 prisoners refugees were handed over to Rwandan authorities on Friday Gatera said

4215 Revered skull of S. Africa king is Scottish woman 's 
4216 JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-24 
4217 A limelight-loving South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from Scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor but to a middle-aged white woman 
4218 A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century King Hintsa a chief of President Nelson Mandela 's Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman 
4219 Chief Nicholas Gcaleka dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia journeyed to a wintry Scotland in February on a hugely publicised quest to find Hintsa 's skull 
4220 The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded Hintsa after a battle in 1835 
4221 But Gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to South Africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely Highland forest near Inverness 
4222 He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there 
4223 Members of the Xhosa royal family branding Gcaleka a charlatan confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come as supposed from a bullet 
4224 It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king the scientist said in a statement

4316 Clinton campaign busy making news 
4317 Laurence McQuillan 
4318 WASHINGTON 1996-08-24 
4319 President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy making news or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year 
4320 With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole 
4321 After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly announce a development in the war on crime 
4322 Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders Clinton said 
4323 That plan has now reached my desk 
4324 Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals not just in a single state but wherever they go he said 
4325 Actually creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger 
4326 Attorney General Janet Reno 's report all nine pages of it including footnotes offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established 
4327 Two months ago Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established 
4328 Now 60 days later he had a chance to talk about it again 
4329 It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election 
4330 Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House they are part of his political chess game 
4331 In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system 
4332 America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement Clinton said without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate 
4333 America is on the right track offering more opportunity demanding more responsibility building a stronger community the sense of shared values and stronger families he said in striking the theme of his coming week 
4334 According to a senior campaign official Clinton will be making a lot of news in the coming week something different each day 
4335 Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia Kentucky Ohio Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago 
4336 He 'll make news during the day and then at night the attention will go to the convention said the campaign official 
4337 We think it 'll work really well 
4338 Although officials decline to say just what each day 's news will be the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention 
4339 Each day of the trip will have a late start so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes 
4340 Campaign officials then hope the day 's news event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme 
4341 We 'll be concentrating on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry 
4342 McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience he will set out a road map for the nation 's future one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years

4346 Edouard is getting stronger and stronger and it already has winds of 105 mph 185 kph said hurricane forecaster Lixion Avila

4355 German troops to remain in Bosnia for 1997--Ruehe 
4356 BONN 1996-08-24 
4357 Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said that German troops would stay on in Bosnia next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace a newspaper reported on Saturday 
4358 The current NATO-led peace force IFOR in Bosnia is due to return home at the end of the year 
4359 But Ruehe told Bild am Sonntag in an interview that a new and different mandate for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in December 
4360 After the Bosnian elections on September 14 the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 60,000 to about 20,000 
4361 A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year Ruehe said 
4362 The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a NATO meeting he told the newspaper in an interview excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday 
4363 But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former Yugoslavia is being perceived in the long run as an occupation 
4364 On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres he said 
4365 Italian comics hope independence-joke 's on Bossi 
4366 ORVIETO Italy 1996-08-24 
4367 A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome 
4368 Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics including popular actor Roberto Benigni would declare Orvieto capital of Etruria on September 15 the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome 
4369 We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia Corsica and Cyprus Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday 
4370 He said the city council would be ironically present when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania the name he has given to northern Italy 
4371 Orvieto located in Umbria between Rome and Florence was once the capital of Etruria an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns 
4372 We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 Cimicchi said 
4373 We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession he added 
4374 Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally 
4375 He has recently dropped a drive for federalism saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners 
4376 Italian farmer says he mutilated four women 
4377 VERONA Italy 1996-08-24 
4378 An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday 
4379 It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women 
4380 ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women remembering only that he had found them lifeless in his arms after having sadmasochistic sex with them 
4381 Stevanin arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute is accused of murdering five women three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 1995 
4382 Two of the corpses were identified but not the third found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal 
4383 Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river 
4384 Dal Maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder saying only that the interrogations are not over yet with investigators 
4385 It said investigators believed Stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads 
4386 Stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by 
4387 Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police 
4388 Jeremy Lovell 
4389 BRUSSELS 1996-08-24 
4390 Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe 
4391 Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux managed to prey on children unhindered for so long 
4392 In just over a week two young girls have been found dead from starvation two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others 
4393 On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at Mont-sur-Marchienne both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi 
4394 Both houses are owned by Dutroux 
4395 Belgian media speculated that Dutroux charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children must have had high level protection to molest youngsters 
4396 They put forward no proof to support the speculation but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case if I am allowed to 
4397 Bourlet said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized some of which featured Dutroux 
4398 Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi 
4399 Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses 
4400 Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo had been kidnapped in June last year 
4401 Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later 
4402 He also admitted kidnapping two other girls An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks a year ago 
4403 The fate of the girls is unknown but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor 
4404 Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague 
4405 Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin charged as an accomplice 
4406 The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association 
4407 Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established 
4408 At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling incompetence and indifference 
4409 Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed Othello against Dutroux in 1995 when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped 
4410 They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was 
4411 They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours 
4412 Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up 
4413 There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support managed to own six houses 
4414 Death toll of Algeria bomb put at seven-newspaper 
4415 PARIS 1996-08-24 
4416 An Algerian newspaper on Saturday put at seven two women and five children the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of Algiers on Friday

4419 El-Watan paper said the blast killed seven a mother and her 25-year-old daughter four young boys and a five-year-old girl 
4420 Several people were also wounded it said 
4421 The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in Algeria 's four-year-old civil strife 
4422 The government-appointed watchdog Human Rights National Observatory was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 1,400 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem rebels in the past two years 
4423 An estimated 50,000 Algerians and more than 110 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead

4450 Internet Startup funded to develop Java software 
4451 MOUNTAIN VIEW Calif. 1996-08-25 
4452 A small team of engineers from Sun Microsystems Inc. 's JavaSoft unit said Sunday they have formed a new company dubbed Internet Startup to build Java infrastructure software 
4453 The fledgling company established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo Park Calif .. 
4454 David Cowan Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive is a general partner of Bessemer 
4455 The startup company 's acting chairman is Jim Bidzos the president of RSA Data Security a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. as well as chairman of VeriSign 
4456 Internet Startup which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees combines experience at JavaSoft Apple Computer Inc. and Oracle Systems 
4457 Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet said Hong Bui vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft 
4458 Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner 
4459 Just last week Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund startups developing Java technologies 
4460 Java has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations ranging from Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. to the Taiwan government 
4461 Prasad Wagle another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious 
4462 One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes known as applets because they are small applications can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use 
4463 In this model individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time also saving costs of memory and storage 
4464 Chris Zuleeg a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com 
4465 Bessemer has funded numerous Internet pioneers including PSI Net VeriSign and Individual 
4466 GOLF MICKELSON WINS FOURTH TITLE OF YEAR IN AKRON 
4467 AKRON Ohio 1996-08-25 
4468 Phil Mickelson birdied two of the last three holes to win World Series of Golf by three strokes over Billy Mayfair on Sunday 
4469 It was the fourth tournament title this year for Mickelson who shot an even-par 70 after being tied for the lead with Billy Mayfair with three holes to play 
4470 Along with Mayfiar at 277 for the tournament were Steve Stricker who had a 68 and Duffy Waldorf with a 66 
4471 It was very hard to sleep last night because there was so much I could accomplish with this win said Mickelson who had a three-stroke lead entering the third round 
4472 This was a win I wanted very very much 
4473 Mickelson 's victory gave him a 10 year exemption to the PGA Tour 
4474 The $ 378,000 first place check brings Mickelson back to the top of the money list with $ 1,574,799 won this year 
4475 This is a major championship golf course and for me to perform well on this style of course is a big step up for me in my career and my performance in future majors he said 
4476 Mickelson three-stroke lead was cut to two when Mayfair birdied the course 's only easy hole the par five second hole while Mickelson three-putted for par from 25 feet 
4477 On the back nine Mickelson began driving erratically and poor tee shots resulted in bogeys on the eighth 12th and 13th holes bringing Mickelson back to four under par tied with Mayfair who had parred 14 straight holes after the birdie on no.2 
4478 Mickelson then set up a tap in birdie on the 16th sending a wedge shot to 18 inches 
4479 He had another birdie on the 17th where he his a 6-iron to six feet 
4480 Mayfair bogeyed the 17th missing a five foot par putt and dropped from solo second place to a three way tie for second 
4481 It was the second successive year in which Mayfair has finished runner up in this tournament 
4482 He lost to Greg Norman in sudden death last year 
4483 The defending champion was in contention two behind Mickelson for much of the day until he bogeyed the 13th and 14th holes

4862 MOTORCYCLING JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES 
4863 SUGO Japan 1996-08-25 
4864 Teenager Yuuichi Takeda racing in only his first season outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday 
4865 Takeda 18 showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser last year 's championship runner-up with four of the 25 laps left 
4866 Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap 
4867 But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third 
4868 Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph 
4869 Corser who crashed during practice on Friday limped in fourth four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner 
4870 In the second race Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki 
4871 Aoki the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag 
4872 Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph and then by Takeda 
4873 With Takeda out of the race Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki 
4874 Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place 
4875 But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254

4895 CRICKET POLLOCK CONCLUDES WARWICKSHIRE CAREER WITH FLOURISH 
4896 LONDON 1996-08-25 
4897 South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire 
4898 Pollock who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 
4899 After an hour 's interruption for rain Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games 
4900 Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire Nottinghamshire and Surrey 
4901 Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table reaching a career best 111 not out against Lancashire 
4902 Lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours 
4903 Yorkshire eventually reached their target with only four wickets down and 7.5 overs to spare

5036 CRICKET RUN-OUT GIVES LEWIS AND ENGLAND SLIM SATISFACTION 
5037 LONDON 1996-08-25 
5038 Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval 
5039 A super piece of fielding by Lewis dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval a lead of 87 
5040 The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove 
5041 There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails 
5042 Lewis though could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms 
5043 Wasim rattled along to 30 not out outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role 
5044 Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch forcing the ground-staff into action yet again 
5045 The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 1445 local time 1345 GMT

5451 SOCCER CHAMPIONS PORTO KICK OFF SEASON WITH A DRAW 
5452 LISBON 1996-08-25 
5453 Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time 
5454 Porto who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute 
5455 Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time 
5456 Setubal who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto 's new Polish keeper Andrejez Wozniak 
5457 Conde scored his second in the 70th minute 
5458 Benfica also playing their first game of the season at home were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence 
5459 Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury 
5460 He was substituted by Paulao 
5461 Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee 's nose 
5462 Braga defender Idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net

5470 SOCCER FIORENTINA WIN WITH BATISTUTA DOUBLE 
5471 MILAN 1996-08-25 
5472 Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta gave Fiorentina the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a 2-1 Supercup victory over serie A champions Milan 
5473 The victory coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in 1926 also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the Cup winners had won 
5474 Batistuta gave Fiorentina the lead in the 11th minute 
5475 Sweden 's Stefan Schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and Batistuta did the rest chipping veteran defender Franco Baresi and scoring at the near post 
5476 Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team weaving past a defender checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance 
5477 The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming Batistuta took charge 
5478 French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in 1991 was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out 
5479 The 83rd minute shot curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team 
5480 Milan 's player of the year George Weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate Roberto Baggio did not play due to injury 
5481 New Dutch signing Edgar Davids came on late in the second half as a Milan substitute but made little impact

5811 RUGBY UNION All Blacks relive triumph 
5812 PRETORIA Aug 25 Captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his All Blacks revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over South Africa NZPA reported 
5813 Most of the test 15 who beat the Springboks 33-26 to secure New Zealand 's first-ever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat Loftus Versfeld 
5814 Magnificent said Fitzpatrick New Zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward 
5815 The players relived the moves and tries the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued 
5816 Zinzan Brooke the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup added a second to his name yesterday 
5817 I was right here he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick 
5818 The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball 
5819 When halfback Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way 
5820 I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there 
5821 It cost me a few bucks at the bar 
5822 The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one Brooke said 
5823 It was just like the World Cup the ball came and the chance was there 
5824 Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match 
5825 We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide they just kept coming at you he said 
5826 I was gone in the first 20 minutes completely exhausted but you had no choice 
5827 There was just so much riding on it 
5828 It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday 
5829 Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending 
5830 He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there Wilson recalled 
5831 About 4000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital 
5832 Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel 
5833 All Blacks coach John Hart said Prime Minister Jim Bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations 
5834 He thanked us on behalf of the country which is really nice for the team and I understand we had tremendous support at home

5887 South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers 
5888 Anton Ferreira 
5889 CAPE TOWN 1996-08-25 
5890 South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands 
5891 Leaders of the major parties involved from right-wing whites to radical blacks appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid 
5892 Most including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers 
5893 But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating 
5894 Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission the amnesty committee 
5895 I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got he said 
5896 That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all 
5897 The commission which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds 
5898 But others such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee have yet to testify 
5899 Tutu 's deputy chairman Alex Boraine told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week 
5900 He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called 
5901 But Currin who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims 
5902 A person can be forced to appear but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee 
5903 At the moment this is not the case 
5904 He cited Coetzee who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks 
5905 His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that 
5906 Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission 
5907 Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied 
5908 Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled separate submission but one black caller to a radio talk show declared 
5909 This whole thing is utterly useless it does n't help us at all 
5910 What the people expect is to have houses to have jobs 
5911 Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission 
5912 Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation 
5913 One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary he said 
5914 Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred saying 
5915 In the irritation in the jokes in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission I think there 's a moral uneasiness and I think that 's healthy 
5916 Responsibility is percolating downwards 
5917 Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serb-held town 
5918 Samir Arnaut 
5919 MATUZICI Bosnia 1996-08-25 
5920 Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia 's elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town cementing partition of the country 
5921 They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived 
5922 The refugees rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union 
5923 We demand to vote in Doboj other banners said 
5924 Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war new places of residence 
5925 As a result separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there 
5926 Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition de facto or de jure 
5927 Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented Edhem Efendija Camdzic Doboj 's Islamic imam-in-exile told the refugees 
5928 The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us said Reuf Mehemdagic head of Doboj municipality-in-exile 
5929 Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there 
5930 How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ? 
5931 But no one will stop us from returning to our homes 
5932 Mirhunisa Komarica a government refugee official said We want to vote where we were thrown out from 
5933 This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible so let them shoot 
5934 Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic a Moslem told the refugees We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that 
5935 To loud applause he added We will enter Doboj untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all 
5936 We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own separatist politics 
5937 The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines 
5938 But local police controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders 
5939 The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's 1992-95 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east 
5940 NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj 
5941 But the crowd dispersed without incident 
5942 Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town 
5943 Eight killed in Moscow casino blaze 
5944 MOSCOW 1996-08-25 
5945 Eight people died on Sunday in a blaze at a Moscow casino which the fire service said might have been started deliberately Interfax news agency said 
5946 The number of casinos has soared in Moscow since the collapse of communism 
5947 The mayor has said he wants to cut their number to five as part of a war against organised crime 
5948 President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on fighting crime in July and handed wide-ranging powers to security chief Alexander Lebed currently engaged in making peace in breakaway Chechnya 
5949 Russian troops start pullout but not in Grozny 
5950 SHATOI Russia 1996-08-25 
5951 Russian troops began to pull out from southern Chechnya on Sunday under a ceasefire agreement between Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and rebel leaders 
5952 But in the capital Grozny the commander of Russian Interior Ministry forces in Chechnya General Anatoly Shkirko told Interfax news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of Chechens disarmed an armoured column 
5953 Reuters cameraman Liutauras Stremaitis said a column of around 40 vehicles including tanks armoured personnel carriers artillery cannons and lorries escorted by Chechen rebels pulled out of the village of Shatoi towards the border around 50 km 31 miles to the north 
5954 In Grozny Shkirko told Interfax he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the Chechens were returned 
5955 Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of Chechens 
5956 He said later that the rebels had handed them over 
5957 The pullout of the Russian troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by Lebed which aims to end the 20-month Chechnya conflict 
5958 Leftist Mexican armed group says troops in capital 
5959 MEXICO CITY 1996-08-25 
5960 The leftist Popular Revolutionary Army EPR in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout Mexico including the capital and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state 
5961 Commanders Vicente and Oscar guarded by a dozen EPR gunmen said in an interview with La Jornada outside Mexico City that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government 
5962 They government officials want to present us before public opinion as a local problem as just being from Guerrero and as irrational radicals Commander Oscar told La Jornada 
5963 They said the ERP whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero on June 28 had a 23,000-strong membership but this could not be confirmed independently 
5964 La Jornada also reported on Sunday that the Mexican Army has discovered a 37-page EPR manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies 
5965 It quoted the manual as saying The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the EPR basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie 
5966 It was the second time armed commanders of the EPR have granted interviews outside Guerrero state an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities 
5967 Unlike the better known and unrelated Zapatista rebels in southeastern Chiapas state the EPR has never taken on the army in direct combat according to official reports 
5968 There have only been a few skirmishes in Guerrero in which a handful of police soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured 
5969 Ten people gunned down in northwest Colombia 
5970 BOGOTA Colombia 1996-08-25 
5971 Unidentified gunmen dragged 10 men out ot their homes in a rural area of Colombia 's northwest province of Antioquia and shot them to death authorities said on Sunday 
5972 Police said the killings occurred on Saturday morning in the municipality of Anza but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of Medellin early on Sunday 
5973 Anza is only 20 miles 30 km west of Medellin but there are no roads linking it directly to the city 
5974 Police initially said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC rebels were prime suspects in the killings 
5975 But gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across Antioquia for years and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group

5981 Two Thai border police wounded by Burma gunmen 
5982 MAE SOT Thailand 1996-08-25 
5983 Two Thai border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a Burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest Thailand security officers said 
5984 The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some 30 members of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army DKBA ambushed their patrol on the Thai side of the border with Burma to the north of the town of Mae Sot 
5985 The Thai army commander in the area Col Suvit Maenmuan told reporters the DKBA which is allied with the Rangoon military government and based in southeast Burma had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration 
5986 Suvit said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier 
5987 The DKBA was formed in late 1994 by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the anti-Rangoon Karen National Union KNU and allied themselves with Burmese government army their former enemies 
5988 DKBA members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on Karen refugee camps in Thailand where the majority of inhabitants are KNU supporters and on Thai villages and police posts near the border 
5989 Bangkok has complained to Rangoon about the raids but Burmese military authorities say they have no contol over the faction 
5990 Thai army commanders reject the explanation saying they have evidence the Burmese army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction

5996 Egypt hopes jars will reveal secrets of mummies 
5997 CAIRO 1996-08-25 
5998 Archaeologists in Egypt have found pots used by ancient Egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification 
5999 Mohammed Saleh director of the Egyptian Museum told Reuters television a U.S. team found the pots some of which contain human intestines in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in Dahshour a village 40 km 25 miles south of Cairo 
6000 Dahshour is the site of Egypt 's second largest pyramid built for the pharaoh Seneferu more than 4,500 years ago 
6001 Saleh said the team from New York 's Metropolitan Museum found four Canopic jars and two unguent jars in the tomb which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the 12th Dynasty 1991-1786 BC in the Middle Kingdom 
6002 This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet Saleh said 
6003 We hope that the analysis of such substances and liquids will reveal some secrets of the mummification process and materials used in this process he added

6032 Israeli President Ezer Weizman weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a spokesman said 
6033 Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks the prime minister 's spokesman said 
6034 Earlier the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process 
6035 But the official Aryeh Shumer said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces 
6036 The newspaper said Netanyahu who is cool to meeting Arafat himself opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president 
6037 After Moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in Israel in February and March Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended 
6038 Shumer said his current position was that the peace process must continue

6065 Israeli president invites Arafat to home paper 
6066 JERUSALEM 1996-08-25 
6067 Israeli President Ezer Weizman has invited Yasser Arafat to meet him at his private home Israel 's biggest newspaper said on Sunday 
6068 The Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the Palestinian president opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week 
6069 The newspaper said Weizman scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after Arafat sent him an emotional appeal to save the peace process 
6070 Netanyahu met Weizman last Tuesday and voiced his opposition Yedioth said 
6071 I am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition that you give me a commitment right now to meet Arafat yourself within 10 days the paper quoted Weizman as telling Netanyahu 
6072 It said Netanyahu had yet to give Weizman an answer 
6073 The office of Israeli president is largely ceremonial

6075 Corporate America taking new view on compensation 
6076 Anne Murray 
6077 NEW YORK 1996-08-23 
6078 Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years according to a recent study 
6079 What it comes down to is this If you 're highly skilled you 'll benefit nicely 
6080 But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals you 'll be paid less 
6081 The survey conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line rather than how well an employee performs a specific task 
6082 Presently for example if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks he or she can expect a certain salary said Sandra O'Neal a Towers Perrin principal 
6083 In the future the accountant will be evaluated solely on knowledge skill and abilities she said 
6084 In addition to using accounting skills the accountant will also have to be creative work well in a team be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals 
6085 The good news is if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities you 'll be paid more said O'Neal 
6086 The bad news is if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team to customer service and the organisation 's goals you 'll be paid less 
6087 Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result 
6088 Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure and 78 percent report that they are considering a new skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees 
6089 This coming shift O'Neal said is not just isolated or a fad 
6090 It 's an inexorable change 
6091 After World War II corporations adopted a military model creating hierarchical organisations where the concept of defined tasks worked great she said 
6092 But as the economy became global customers were more demanding and problems became more complex 
6093 Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers O'Neal said 
6094 Now organisations must change to stay competitive 
6095 O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises 
6096 If your team does well you 'll do well 
6097 If it does n't do well do n't expect a raise 
6098 Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? 
6099 That 's an important question we used to ask a lot said O'Neal 
6100 It 's not a question we ask any more 
6101 The more important question is Do we have results ? 
6102 To get those results 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives such as employee and team award programmes and education 
6103 Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well O'Neal said 
6104 For example the survey rated some participants in the survey as high-performing companies based on their return on equity above 16 percent 
6105 Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success 
6106 They respect employees more they trust employees more and they value their employees more O'Neal said 
6107 The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership 
6108 It will improve a company 's bottom line 
6109 Belgian police arrest detective in Dutroux affair 
6110 Geert de Clercq 
6111 NEUFCHATEAU Belgium 1996-08-25 
6112 Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium 's child sex scandal Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said 
6113 Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft insurance fraud and document forgery Bourlet told a news conference 
6114 He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday including one at the Charleroi judicial police headquarters where Zicot worked 
6115 Zicot 45 is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft 
6116 Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times 
6117 He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year 
6118 Bourlet said two other people had also been arrested 
6119 One was Gerard Pignon the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored 
6120 The other was insurer Thierry Dehaan 
6121 Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested 
6122 He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein an accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe 
6123 Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house belonging to Detroux who said they starved to death earlier this year nine months after being abducted in June 1995 
6124 Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago 
6125 Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft Bourlet said 
6126 Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained Bourlet added 
6127 Anne Thily public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived said this was a major case involving some 50 investigators including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation

6136 A bus fell from a mountain road into a river in Pakistan-ruled Azad free Kashmir on Sunday killing at least 19 people and injuring 11 police said 
6137 They said dead included five refugees from the Indian-ruled part of Kashmir where Moslem militants have waged a separatist revolt since early 1990 
6138 The police said 14 of the 45 passengers on the bus died instantly when the vehicle fell into Kunar river from a narrow road leading from the state capital Muzaffarabad to the nearby Pakistani town of Garhi Habibullah northwest

6140 North Afghan highway opening put off radio says 
6141 ISLAMABAD 1996-08-25 
6142 The planned reopening of Afghanistan 's main northern Salang highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until Wednesday official Kabul Radio said on Sunday 
6143 The embattled Afghan government said last week that the Kabul-Salang highway would be opened on Monday or Tuesday following talks with the Supreme Coordination Council alliance led by Jumbish-i-Milli movement of powerful opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum 
6144 The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to precautions 
6145 It did not elaborate 
6146 The Salang highway Afghanistan 's main route to Central Asia has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government in Kabul in January 1994 in alliance with Hezb-i-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar then prime minister but rival to the president 
6147 Hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with Rabbani and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit 
6148 Earlier this month Jumbish denied a Kabul government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north 
6149 Students burn Hasina effigy battle police

6151 DHAKA 1996-08-25 
6152 Students backed by opposition parties battled police and burned an effigy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during a strike in the north Bangladeshi town of Bogra on Sunday 
6153 The strikers barricaded streets attacked the local office of the ruling Awami League fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular Janakantha newspaper alleging it was pro-government 
6154 Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs witnesses said 
6155 The strike called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party BNP to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days coincided with a visit to the area by Hasina 
6156 Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday 
6157 Hasina told a cross section of people at the Bogra police headquarters on Sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents 
6158 The prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged Bogra residents to call off the strike 
6159 Opposition legislators walked out of parliament in Dhaka on Sunday denouncing unprecedented police barbarity against opposition students and supporters 
6160 They renewed their call for the resignation of Home Interior Minister Rafiqul Islam 
6161 Hundreds of police raided the Dhaka university on Sunday arresting nearly 30 outsiders who had been living in student dormitories and seizing weapons university officials said 
6162 Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage 
6163 They seized revolvers sawn-off rifles shotguns and knives 
6164 The students were later allowed to return 
6165 The swoop followed the resignation of the university 's Vice-Chancellor Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed on Saturday over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus 
6166 Authorities closed down the 28,000-student university on Wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police 
6167 Police said they fought armed activists from the BNP headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia 
6168 Hasina told police the home ministry had already given a blanket order to arrest terrorists and possessors of illegal firearms irrespective of their political identities 
6169 Nearly 100 students have been injured in the clashes in Dhaka and Bogra police told reporters 
6170 16 die as bus crashes in Pakistani Kashmir

6174 Two died later in hospital 
6175 FEATURE Fertile Ukraine faces drought of cash and rain 
6176 Irene Marushko 
6177 BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM Ukraine 1996-08-26 
6178 Four shiny new green-and-yellow John Deere combines parked at this 1,750-hectare 4,325-acre farm in the grain-growing regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm 
6179 They did a good job this year but they need good diesel and good engine oil said Ivan Odnosum 
6180 God help us if there is a breakdown he said of the machinery loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year 
6181 The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame 
6182 A drought scoured the steppes in May and June stunting the growing wheat 
6183 And the farming sector making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money 
6184 Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as rich enough to grow rubber boots 
6185 But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin 
6186 The wheat will not be of a good quality this year said Hryhory Borsuk a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences 
6187 The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees Celsius 143.60 Fahrenheit this summer 
6188 We 've never seen anything so bad he said in an interview in his office unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills 
6189 The harvest is gathered in the dry areas but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there 
6190 While Mironivka 's scientists some unpaid for months carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought 
6191 Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser no money for herbicides and pesticides no money to repair old or buy new machinery no money for fuel and none to buy good seed 
6192 This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 the year before independence 
6193 The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs 
6194 Agriculture is very expensive and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon said Odnosum 
6195 He said his farm its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare 2.5 acres but ended up with 3.9 tonnes still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year 
6196 We did not have money for fertiliser we 're in debt for fuel and we 're borrowing diesel Odnosum said 
6197 A few kilometres miles down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by is the 1,700-hectare 4,200-acre Shevchenko collective farm built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay 
6198 Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance 
6199 The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year $ 800 $ 1,000 but many have not been paid in months Soprun said 
6200 People are working out of their own dedication 
6201 Borsuk said the farm sector has two options We can sit down and cry or we can do something 
6202 He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year 
6203 Planted in late summer and early autumn the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil 
6204 Further plans he said called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 
6205 If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 Borkus said 
6206 The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to 50 hectares 124 acres of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone 
6207 Collective farms will last for the next few years because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell said one private farmer In the future maybe but it 's better not to hurry 
6208 Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain 
6209 And it went too fast 
6210 Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome 
6211 Gencor swells profit despite setbacks 
6212 Melanie Cheary 
6213 JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-26 
6214 Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks 
6215 Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 30 chairman Brian Gilbertson said Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar 
6216 Gencor raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results 
6217 Not everything has gone well 
6218 We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations 
6219 The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure Gilbertson said 
6220 Implats posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously 
6221 Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February March but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August 
6222 The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar 
6223 Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets 
6224 Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains 
6225 It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province 
6226 But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of Implats proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests 
6227 The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger 
6228 From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on Gilbertson said 
6229 Looking ahead to the current financial year he said that Gencor would boost earnings further 
6230 Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future 
6231 The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses 
6232 I think we can look forward to further growth 
6233 Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets 
6234 We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets 
6235 The biggest of those was Malbak 
6236 Overall a very substantial pruning 
6237 leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines Gilbertson said 
6238 He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares which were market for disposal when required 
6239 Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more 
6240 I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it 's the question of adding value 
6241 When we bought the shares we bought 
6242 at quite a bit lower than the price is now 
6243 maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal 
6244 Finally Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments

6246 Advanced Medical buying IVAC Medical 
6247 SAN DIEGO 1996-08-26 
6248 Advanced Medical Inc. said Monday it will buy IVAC Medical Systems Inc. a former Eli Lilly & Co 
6249 unit for about $ 400 million in cash creating one of the world 's largest makers of intravenous infusion therapy products 
6250 Under the agreement IVAC and Advanced Medical 's wholly owned subsidiary IMED Corp. will merge to form a new company that will develop and manufacture infusion pumps that regulate the amount of intravenous fluid being administered to a patient as well as proprietary disposable products 
6251 The combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 353 million 
6252 Advanced Medical through IMED is already one of the nation 's largest developers and manufacturers of intravenous infusion pumps and proprietary disposable products 
6253 It has sales in 38 foreign countries 
6254 San Diego-based IVAC is a major provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the health-care industry 
6255 It has manufacturing plants in San Diego ; Creedmoor N.C. ; Hampshire England ; and Tijuana Mexico and distributes its prodcuts in more than 120 countries 
6256 Eli Lilly sold IVAC on Dec. 31 1994 to DLJ Merchant Banking Partners LP River Medical Inc. and other investors 
6257 Advanced Medical said it expects to take an unspecified one-time charge to pay for the merger 
6258 It did not say when the charge would be taken 
6259 The addition of IVAC is expected to contribute to financial results in the full second quarter of 1997 the companies said 
6260 The merger will add to both companies historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices they said 
6261 In 1968 IVAC introduced the world 's first infusion therapy monitoring device 
6262 A year later IVAC improved its system with the addition of an IV pump that regulated the flow of liquids through positive pressure 
6263 IMED introduced the world 's first volumetric infusion pump in 1974 
6264 IMED had profits of $ 1.7 million or 6 cents per fully diluted common share on $ 53.9 million in revenues in the first half of 1996 
6265 Excluding the effect of a one-time restructuring charge of $ 17.4 million IVAC had net income of $ 4.2 million on net sales of $ 112.8 million for the 1996 first half 
6266 Advanced Medical reported profits of $ 8.4 million on sales of $ 29.2 million in the quarter ended June 30 
6267 William J. Mercer IVAC president and chief executive officer will become the president and CEO of Advanced Medical 
6268 He led the transition of IVAC to a privately held company and was previously senior vice president at Mallinckrodt Group Inc 
6269 Joseph Kuhn Advanced Medical and IMED president will become the new company 's executive vice president and chief financial officer 
6270 The deal is expected to close by the first quarter of 1997 subject to regulatory approval 
6271 It has already been approved by both companies boards

6284 Captain and goalkicker Bobbie Goulding scored 18 points 
6285 St Helens 's triumph marked the end of Wigan 's seven-year reign as British champions

6287 They were also the toast of London Broncos who managed to scrape into the top four ahead of Warrington and qualify for the end-of-season play-offs 
6288 Bradford finished third 
6289 St Helens have now set their sights on taking the treble by winning the end-of-season premiership which begins with next Sunday 's semifinal against London

6307 Tommi Makinen took a significant step towards becoming world rally champion with a brilliant victory in the 1000 Lakes Rally on Monday 
6308 Mitsubishi driver Makinen stopped experienced fellow Finn Juha Kankkunen in his tracks on the final day of the 1,452-km rally doubling his lead on the first two decisive stages 
6309 This was the most difficult win three days at 125 percent effort said Makinen whose success completed his 1,000 Lakes hat-trick 
6310 Kankkunen was runner-up in his Toyota as Finland 's Jarmo Kytolehto produced a remarkable drive to finish third in his Ford 
6311 Swede Kenneth Eriksson kept Subaru in the hunt for the manufacturers title with fifth place in spite of a gearbox problem that nearly forced him off the road close to the end of the event 
6312 Maakinen 's and Mitsubishi 's positions were strengthened by the late retirement of Spain 's Carlos Sainz when his Ford gearbox failed

6317 SOCCER SHARPE HITS WINNER TO EASE PRESSURE ON LEEDS 
6318 LEEDS England 1996-08-26 
6319 Winger Lee Sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give Leeds their first win of the season on Monday and leave hapless Wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the England premier league 
6320 Sharpe repaid a huge slice of the 4.5 million pound $ 6.98 million fee Leeds handed Manchester United for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand Wimbledon their third successive defeat 
6321 Ian Rush the Welsh striker signed from Liverpool in the close season set up the goal feeding Sharpe as he galloped forward and the former England winger cut inside onto his unfavoured right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net 
6322 The only goal of the match also brought some relief for under-fire Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson following the team 's poor start to the season 
6323 Home fans frequently booed their own side until Sharpe turned the jeers to cheers

6562 The tiny islands of the Seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup 
6563 Trailing fellow Indian Ocean islanders Mauritius 1-0 from the first leg they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match 
6564 The 2-1 aggregate took Mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals and kept up the Seychelles record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of FIFA membership 
6565 The Seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder Andre Caboche was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute 
6566 But the visitors responded to the setback immediately veteran striker Ashley Mocude scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead 
6567 Although Danny Rose 's 50th-minute equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated 
6568 Mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against Malawi Mozambique and favourites Zambia 
6569 Namibia who drew 0-0 with Botswana in their first leg won the second leg in Windhoek 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage 
6570 They now play in group five with Cameroon Gabon and Kenya 
6571 German-based striker Bachirou Salou returned home to Togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against Congo 
6572 Salou who plays for MSV Duisburg in the Bundesliga scored in the 53rd minute of Sunday 's match in Lome for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six where they will meet Liberia Tanzania and Zaire 
6573 Ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in Addis Ababa to overcome Uganda after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline 
6574 Both legs ended 1-1 before Ethiopia won the spot kick decider 4-2 
6575 Uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by Angola in June 's World Cup qualifying preliminaries

6623 SWIMMING POPOV IN `SERIOUS CONDITION AFTER STABBING 
6624 MOSCOW 1996-08-26 
6625 Russian double Olympic swimming champion Alexander Popov was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a Moscow street 
6626 A doctor said it was too early to say whether Popov the only man to retain the Olympic 50 and 100 metres freestyle titles would return to top-level sport 
6627 His condition is serious said Rimma Maslova deputy chief doctor of Hospital No 31 in the Russian capital 
6628 But he is conscious and is talking and smiling 
6629 Maslova told Reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine but said it was too early to judge Popov 's chances of returning to competitive swimming 
6630 Popov who won gold in the 50 and 100 metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow 
6631 Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney 
6632 Doctors operated on Popov 24 for three hours 
6633 Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly 
6634 There 's no need to worry 
6635 We 're going to be walking soon and swimming he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit 
6636 Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers 
6637 It said the row started when Popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party 
6638 Vitaly Smirnov president of the Russian National Olympic Committee said President Boris Yeltsin had given the swimmer Russia 's top award for his Olympic performance 
6639 I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right said Smirnov 
6640 Smirnov said the Olympic Committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in post-Soviet Russia

6771 SOCCER PLAYERS LEAVE MATCH EARLY TO CATCH PLANE 
6772 Brian Homewood 
6773 RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-08-26 
6774 Two key players left a Brazilian championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to Russia to play with the national team 
6775 Sao Paulo midfielder Andre and Santos defender Narciso were both substituted during their teams game taken to Sao Paulo airport and flown to Rio de Janeiro in a private jet chartered by the Brazilian Football Confederation CBF 
6776 At Rio they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to Moscow where Brazil will face Russia in a friendly international on Wednesday 
6777 The problem arose because the Sao Paulo-Santos clash was selected as the day 's televised live match forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time 
6778 Santos suffered more from their loss as Narciso 's replacement Jean gave away a penalty from which Sao Paulo scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 win 
6779 Sao Paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package Juventude who beat Internacional 2-1 
6780 Corinthians who played in a tournament in Spain last week also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list 
6781 They were due to leave Spain Monday night arrive in Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning catch another plane to the southern city of Curitiba one hour later and then play away to Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship the same evening 
6782 Botafogo striker Tulio who was overlooked by Zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the Netherlands on Sunday scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat Bahia 2-1 away 
6783 Tulio who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons has been struggling against injury for most of this year

6907 TENNIS QUENCH YOUR THIRST IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT AT U.S. OPEN 
6908 Bill Berkrot 
6909 NEW YORK 1996-08-26 
6910 A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids sound advice until you check out the price of fluids 
6911 Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding ...and bring plenty of money 
6912 A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ 3.75 while a litre of basic life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 for water ? 
6913 At the Olympics water was only a dollar and that was the Olympics said one incredulous fan noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging 
6914 U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw 
6915 When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans turn to be offended 
6916 That baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home 
6917 A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good but Carol Perry chimed in The water is ridiculous they want four dollars for the water you might as well get a glass of wine 
6918 Indeed a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 
6919 What 's the message here ? 
6920 Maybe they want us to be alcoholics Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine 
6921 Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries 
6922 And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty 
6923 Make that $ 16.50 
6924 Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 
6925 Of course it is served on a tuscan roll 
6926 It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich 
6927 TENNIS HUBER AND MALEEVA FALL UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN 
6928 Larry Fine 
6929 NEW YORK 1996-08-26 
6930 Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships 
6931 The 15-year-old Hingis seeded 16th was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked Angeles Montolio of Spain 
6932 It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court said a cheery Hingis who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard 
6933 Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria 
6934 Huber who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 
6935 Coetzer ranked 17th avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 
6936 I looked at it as not a first round match just a great challenge for me said Coetzer 24 
6937 I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm 
6938 She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down 
6939 She played one great game and than a few errors 
6940 The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game 
6941 Huber who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach could only mourn her luck of the draw 
6942 I was n't happy when I saw the draw 
6943 She was the first non- seeded player said the 21-year-old German 
6944 It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam 
6945 I think I did n't play that bad today 
6946 It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played 
6947 Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland ranked 110th 
6948 The 18-year-old Olsza last year 's Wimbledon junior champion celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 6-4 6-2 
6949 The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks 
6950 The Swiss teenager a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open 
6951 I hope I can get into the last 16 said Hingis seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round 
6952 Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds 3.5 kilos in advance of the championships 
6953 There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there she said 
6954 Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there too 
6955 The fast-moving Olsza 18 was cool in her opening match 
6956 I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva said Olsza 
6957 I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared 
6958 Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros 
6959 In terms of tennis I think the junior players are really good now 
6960 In a few years it could change a lot among the top players 
6961 Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents 
6962 Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands the 13th seed was a 6-1 6-4 winner over Japan 's Nana Miyaga while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio 6-2 6-3 
6963 Austrian Barbara Paulus seeded 14th also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China 
6964 TENNIS STICH GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY 
6965 Richard Finn 
6966 NEW YORK 1996-08-26 
6967 Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas 
6968 I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say That 's it said Stich one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week 
6969 But there are so many reasons to play especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis that I decided to stay 
6970 In a break from tradition the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players 
6971 One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding withdrew and returned home to Russia 
6972 Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury 
6973 At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players outrage at the seedings 
6974 The way the U.S. Open has seeded here tampering with the ranking system has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players mind and we think that is damaging to our sport Martin said 
6975 Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest 
6976 I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA 
6977 They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have said Stich 
6978 I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow 
6979 But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam 
6980 He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court 
6981 Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American Malivai Washington the Wimbledon runner-up Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain who will be Stich 's next opponent 
6982 The suspicion however lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players 
6983 I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players said Stich who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi 
6984 It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday 
6985 The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six 
6986 He Agassi should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon 
6987 Stich not seeded here for the first time since 1990 might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew 
6988 Ranked 18th in the world Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally 
6989 But Stich did n't want to play that game 
6990 I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded Stich said

7055 BASEBALL CUBS EDGE BRAVES WITH RUN IN TOP OF NINTH 
7056 ATLANTA 1996-08-25 
7057 Brian McRae singled in Tyler Houston in the top of the ninth inning to snap a tie as the Chicago Cubs avoided a three-game sweep with 3-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Sunday 
7058 The Braves scored four runs in the ninth for a 6-5 victory on Saturday 
7059 Kevin Foster 5-2 won his second straight start allowing two runs and six hits with two walks and three strikeouts over eight innings 
7060 The biggest thing was my fastball I was able to rotate it pretty good Foster said 
7061 Also I was able to keep my changeup down 
7062 At Colorado Vinny Castilla homered twice and drove in four runs and Larry Walker went 3-for-4 with a homer and three RBI as the Colorado Rockies outslugged the Pittsburgh Pirates 13-9 in the rubber game of a three-game series 
7063 Castilla 's first homer of the game a solo shot in the seventh off reliever Marc Wilkins 3-1 extended Colorado 's lead to 9-7 
7064 He added a three-run homer in the eighth off John Ericks to make it 13-8 
7065 At Florida Edgar Renteria 's two-out single in the bottom of the ninth inning scored Jesus Tavarez with the winning run as the Florida Marlins edged the Cincinnati Reds 6-5 
7066 Right after Edgar made contact I knew I had to score said Tavarez 
7067 I knew I would score even if he fielded it cleanly he could n't throw me out 
7068 Edgar is a tremendous player right now said Florida manager John Boles 
7069 But I ca n't wait to see how good he 'll be when he grows up 
7070 In San Francisco Osvaldo Fenandez fired a seven-hitter and Trenidad Hubbard belted a two-run homer as the San Francisco Giants ended a three-game losing streak by defeating the Montreal Expos 7-2 
7071 Fernandez 6-13 allowed two runs walked one and struck out eight for his second career complete game both against Montreal 
7072 In Los Angeles Greg Gagne had a run-scoring single and Chad Curtis drew a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the eighth inning as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied for a 6-5 victory and a three-game sweep of the New York Mets 
7073 It was one of these games where you get three straight pinch-hits and a walk of a pinch-hitter that 's how you win pennants Dodgers manager Bill Russell said 
7074 Mike Piazza 
7075 In San Diego Steve Finley and Jody Reed drove in three runs apiece as the San Diego Padres built a six-run lead after three innings and cruised to an 11-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies 
7076 Ken Caminiti added two RBI for the Padres who have won six of their last seven games and remained one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West 
7077 In Houston Jeff Bagwell homered and Donne Wall allowed one run over seven innings as the Houston Astros defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 4-1 
7078 Wall 8-4 allowed three hits walked two and struck out seven as the Astros moved 1-1/2 games ahead of the Cardinals for the lead in the National League Central 
7079 He left the game with a knot in his right shoulder

7242 Lamonts Apparel files reorganization plan 
7243 [ CORRECTED 18:00 GMT ] 
7244 KIRKLAND Wash 
7245 1996-08-26 
7246 Lamonts Apparel Inc an operator of 42 family apparel stores in six northwestern states said it has filed a reorganization plan in bankruptcy court in Seattle 
7247 Corrects to make clear a reorganization plan has been filed 
7248 The reorganization plan calls for all secured claims to be paid in full 
7249 Unsecured claims including those of company bondholders will be satisfied by issuing new common stock and warrants 
7250 Unsecured claims are estimated at about $ 90 million 
7251 Lamonts said it plans to issue 9 million shares of new common stock 
7252 Of that amount 4.05 million and 5.67 million shares will be allocated to the company 's trade creditors 
7253 Between 4.75 and 3.13 million shares will be allocated to bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors and 200,000 will be allocated to existing shareholders in exchange for all existing stock of the company 
7254 Bondholders and other unsecured non-trade creditors will receive warrants four about 2.2 million shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 20 million 
7255 Bondholders other unsecured non-trade creditors and existing shareholders also will receive warrants entitling them to roughly 800,000 shares when the company 's market capitalization reaches $ 25 million 
7256 Management will receive options to purchase 10 percent of the company 's outstanding common stock with protection against dilution at an option exercise price of $ 1 million 
7257 Passengers rescued from blazing ferry off France 
7258 LONDON 1996-08-26 
7259 More than 100 people were safely evacuated on Monday from a ferry that caught fire soon after leaving Guernsey in Britain 's Channel Islands police said 
7260 Police said the 111 passengers and six crew on board the ferry Trident Seven owned by France 's Emeraud line were rescued by a variety of private and commercial boats after fire broke out in the engine room soon after it left port 
7261 An 88-year-old woman was taken to hospital with leg injuries according to a spokesman for Guernsey police 
7262 The ferry which was towed into port had been bound for Jersey another in a cluster of small British-ruled islands off north-west France 
7263 OSCE delays decision on refugee voting 
7264 Kurt Schork 
7265 SARAJEVO 1996-08-26 
7266 Bosnia 's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday 
7267 Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees 
7268 International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies 
7269 Tomorrow 
7270 the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only 
7271 the other elections will be held on September 14 OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo 
7272 I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled 
7273 I think probably if the decision to cancell were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections .. 
7274 Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table but she refused to specify what they were 
7275 The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections 
7276 The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE 's top rule-making body for the poll 
7277 More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world representing about 20 per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate 
7278 They are due to begin voting on Wednesday August 28 just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision 
7279 Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September 14 when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency 
7280 A Sarajevo daily newspaper Dnevi Avaz which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems 
7281 SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission 
7282 I do n't know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named 
7283 The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue 
7284 Ambassador Robert Frowick an American heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia 
7285 OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war 
7286 Instead the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43-month Bosnian war but which are now underpopulated as a result of ethnic cleansing 
7287 Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war 
7288 The top U.N. refugee official in the Balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday 
7289 Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in Bosia-Hercegovina warned Soren Jessen-Petersen Special Envoy for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Former Yugoslavia 
7290 In the run-up to elections nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic sectarian card drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear 
7291 After truce Lebed faces tougher Chechen problem 
7292 Alastair Macdonald 
7293 MOSCOW 1996-08-26 
7294 Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels 
7295 It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend 
7296 Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia will be no easy matter 
7297 A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny 
7298 He returned at the weekend pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed 
7299 But then he apparently thought better of it 
7300 Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in Moscow he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday 
7301 He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and according to the press service of Lebed 's Security Council could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday 
7302 It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin 's holiday announced later would affect plans to talk 
7303 Moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya 's political future have meanwhile been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments 
7304 It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan 
7305 Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin hardly seen since his reelection last month kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce 
7306 But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin 
7307 If that were the case it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow 
7308 Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow who have profited from the war and want it to go on would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him 
7309 Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by so the Chechens say Russian forces 
7310 Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer 
7311 A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date 
7312 Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions particularly in the strategic North Caucasus 
7313 Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war 
7314 Yeltsin on holiday from Monday Interfax 
7315 MOSCOW 1996-08-26 
7316 Russian President Boris Yeltsin began a new summer holiday on Monday but would remain in control of affairs of state Interfax news agency said 
7317 The head of state 's holiday has only just begun the agency quoted Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying adding that the president was currently in a Kremlin residence near Moscow 
7318 Interfax said Yastrezhembsky did not exclude that Yeltsin could spend some time in other places 
7319 He would continue working on various documents and might meet one state offical or another 
7320 One must give B. Yeltsin a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections Interfax quoted Yastrezhembsky as saying 
7321 Yeltsin controls internal and international policies daily receives a big packet of documents from Moscow which demand his intervention 
7322 Many of those documents return to the president 's administration the same day he said 
7323 Yeltsin went on a two-day trip outside Moscow last week to check out a holiday home 
7324 Yugo Zastava workers protest enters 2nd week 
7325 BELGRADE 1996-08-26 
7326 Thousands of workers of Serbia 's Zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production 
7327 We are stubborn have strength and time to persist until our demands are met said the factory 's trade union secretary Dragutin Stanojlovic 
7328 We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us 
7329 Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year 's holiday pay and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant 
7330 The former Yugoslav national army consumed 90 percent of Zastava 's pre-war output but like the rest of Yugoslavia 's economy the new army of Serbia and Montenegro is crippled by lack of funds 
7331 In Kragujevac where the plant is based 9,000 to 10,000 people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what Stanojlovic called government indifference 
7332 The ruling Socialist Party last week accused Serbia 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers already difficult social position for their own interests 
7333 Late wages no work and the lack of a production programme are the main reasons for their protests a senior member of the local Socialist Party branch told Reuters 
7334 But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections 
7335 Federal Yugoslav elections are due on November 3 
7336 The party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated 
7337 There were about 1,400 to 1,600 people at the protest today much less then last week 
7338 But there were more observers and passers by he said

7341 ZAGREB 1996-08-26 
7342 The Croatian lending rate fell to 8.0 percent on Monday from last Friday 's 9.1 percent after thin demand for kuna forced bank lenders to trim their rates further 
7343 Interbank call money was down to 8.0 from 10.0 percent 
7344 Insurers five-10 and 10-15 day loans were made at a steady 8.0 percent after last week 's drop from an earlier 15 percent 
7345 Total Zagreb Money Market settlements shrank to 17.4 million kuna of which dealers put new borrowing at a meagre 5.5 million 
7346 Supply stood at a high 180 million kuna 
7347 Overnight trade at the weekend left a surplus of 1.2 billion kuna on the supply side after 40 million were settled 
7348 Croatia 's central bank again stayed out of the foreign exchange market 
7349 It calculated the kuna midrates for Tuesday 's trade stronger at 5.2420 against the dollar and slightly weaker at 3.5486 against the German mark

7351 SVCD Bulgaria air traffic controllers to strike September 3 
7352 SOFIA 1996-08-26 
7353 Bulgarian air traffic controllers will go on strike on September 3 demanding higher pay the chief of the Bulgarian association of air traffic controllers Bulatka said on Monday 
7354 Stefan Raichev told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 1,380 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 10 percent since last year 
7355 More than 1,500 planes per day fly over Bulgaria in a strategic location between Europe and the Middle and the Far East Raichev said 
7356 The director general of the air traffic service Valentin Valkov said last Friday that a controllers strike would be illegal 
7357 Valkov said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier Balkan Airlines which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the Bulgarian Black Sea resorts 
7358 But Raichev said it would be discrimination against the other airlines if only Balkan planes were guided in 
7359 Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights Raichev said 
7360 Raichev said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak English 
7361 The controllers are demanding the monthly wage be increased to $ 1,000 per month from the current $ 230 as well as the resignation of the air traffic service 's management 
7362 They also demand the financial separation of the 350 air controllers from the technical staff

7416 Colombian peso closes lower importers buy dlrs 
7417 BOGOTA 1996-08-26 
7418 Colombia 's peso closed lower at 1,044 after coming under pressure from dollar-buying by importers seeking to meet their commitments abroad interbank dealers said 
7419 It was the second consecutive session that saw the peso which ended at 1,041 Friday close lower 
7420 The dollar 's rise was due to demand from importers who have a lot of wire transfers accumulated one dealer said 
7421 Contributing to the peso 's weakness another dealer said banks who might have sold greenbacks in Monday 's trading appeared to shy away from the market 
7422 This according to the trader was typical of month-end position-squaring and the fact that a stronger U.S. currency helps limit some foreign exchange losses 
7423 Dealers reported 355 trades for a total of $ 142 million and said the peso hit an intra-day high of 1,037 before heading lower into the close

7499 Indonesian rupiah stable in quiet late trading 
7500 JAKARTA 1996-08-26 
7501 The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in quiet trading on Monday dealers said 
7502 They said volume was thin following a public holiday in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom 
7503 We did n't see anything from Singapore operators either 
7504 It 's a pretty quiet day one foreign bank dealer said 
7505 Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,342.0 42.5 at 0915 GMT unchanged from the opening level 
7506 It was softer in the morning due to relatively ample rupiah liquidity but recovered later 
7507 Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,342.00 42.45 and 2,341.5 42.0 respectively 
7508 Another dealer said operators were reluctant to unload rupiah despite ample conditions due to the month-end factor 
7509 There are two factors which determine the market at present 
7510 The liquidity at month-end and the next court hearing scheduled for Thursday the dealer said 
7511 Megawati Sukarnoputri deposed leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party PDI has sued the government for ousting her as PDI leader

7514 Megawati 's lawyers said they were still discussing a possible out of court settlement but they was not optimistic an agreement could be reached 
7515 The dealer said this issue remained a factor but its importance to the market seemed to diminish 
7516 He said liquidity would be the main concern for the next few days

7635 Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady following strong demand Monday that lifted prices as much as $ 1.50 per cwt in some areas livestock dealers said

7637 Top prices in Iowa southern Minnesota Tuesday were expected to range from mostly $ 59.50 to $ 60.00 steady following a $ 0.50 $ 1.50 jump Monday

7639 However USDA reported tops of $ 58.00 in Illinois and in Iowa southern Minnesota $ 60.00 on some hogs Monday

7641 Producers were expected to ship as many hogs as they can ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend they said 
7642 Demand for hogs is expected to be light by the end of the week as the industry prepares for Labor Day Monday September 1 when most U.S. packers will be closed

7644 Gore presents new image of lead attack dog 
7645 Michael Posner 
7646 CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
7647 No more mild-mannered and meek Al Gore the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
7648 While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term Gore is the bright star in the convention city now 
7649 Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream 12 more years a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton re-election 
7650 Over a 15-hour span from Sunday evening to Monday morning so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the New York delegation 
7651 In his appearances the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic gesturing pol as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats 
7652 Gore told a roaring labor rally of about 1,000 union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole 's running mate 
7653 With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women Gore said to whoops of 12 more years 
7654 They want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't he added 
7655 They want to silence your voices in elections 
7656 At a downtown hotel Monday the 48-year-old Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore 
7657 I want you to ask this question 
7658 What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition the Gingrich Dole Congress also controlled the executive branch ? 
7659 Gore said 
7660 Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations he warned Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress into and through the Dole White House down through the Supreme Court 
7661 He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now 
7662 Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk 
7663 Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine 
7664 Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children 
7665 Education would be at risk 
7666 The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition he said 
7667 His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as productive opportunity a vision for the future that lifts up working families that builds Wisconsin stronger that builds America stronger 
7668 With your help we can re-elect Bill Clinton 
7669 Dole 's tax cut plans were called deja-voodoo economics .... It 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch 
7670 We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again 
7671 Gore ridiculed Dole 's defense of the tobacco industry praised Clinton for courage in advancing regulations of it 
7672 To the delegates of Wisconsin a leading dairy state Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk 
7673 Some people say milk is bad for you Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow 
7674 He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act and criticized Republicans for slashing money to combat drugs in schools 
7675 The choice has never been starker the stakes today have never been higher Gore said 
7676 We 're not going to let them get away with that 
7677 Actor Reeve highlights Democrats first night 
7678 CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
7679 The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity 
7680 Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep 
7681 Richard Gephardt and Sen 
7682 Thomas Daschle 
7683 Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers 
7684 Sarah Brady The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage 
7685 As head of Handgun Control Inc. Sarah Brady 54 campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 1981 
7686 Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the Brady Bill which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers 
7687 Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr 
7688 suffered serious brain damage 
7689 Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son James Scott Brady Jr 
7690 Before the assassination attempt she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party 
7691 Christopher Reeve Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life 
7692 Reeve an accomplished rider who owned several horses suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper Virginia on May 27 1995 
7693 Almost entirely paralyzed Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine 
7694 That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position 
7695 Over time he regained the power of speech so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention 
7696 Reeve 43 was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man 
7697 He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in Superman and three sequels 
7698 Richard Gephardt Gephardt House Democratic leader is a politician with a Mr Clean reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job 
7699 Gephardt 55 the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis is a consummate congressional insider sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats 
7700 A former lawyer he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill 
7701 He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing 
7702 He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill 
7703 Gephardt a red-haired square-jawed man is a less than fiery orator 
7704 His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment standing up for blue collar workers and farmers 
7705 Tom Daschle Daschle 48 was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 1994 
7706 A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in 1987 he presented himself as a Midwest moderate as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions 
7707 Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage 
7708 In his early Senate years he was seen as a prairie populist working on legislation protecting farmers prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War 
7709 Daschle was a key player in President Bill Clinton 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the White House 
7710 He has made clear he opposed Clinton 's signing of the Republican-initiated welfare reform bill 
7711 He has spent his adult life in politics coming to Congress as an aide in 1972 after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the House of Representatives himself in 1978

7718 A police spokesman said the boy was being questioned 
7719 They are talking to him now about the motive and everything else 
7720 McCullough had adopted the boy who was the grandson of her late husband shortly after his birth but neighbours said they often had loud arguments

7733 There is no market at the moment one Rotterdam trader said

7735 Outright gas oil prices were notionally softer as the NYMEX heating oil contract headed lower and following news that the Indian Oil Corp IOC had issued a tender to buy only 120,000 tonnes of high speed diesel for October 
7736 Asian traders had earlier expected an IOC tender for around 400,000 tonnes 
7737 ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 1 a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels while Antwerp material was available for 0-50 cents over September 
7738 The IOC tender had a bearish impact but not a great impact one German player said 
7739 Fuel oil markets were also listless 
7740 Offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ 102 fob ARA but bids were scarce

7757 CLEVELAND 1996-08-26 
7758 Brush Wellman Inc said Monday that 10 of 24 lawsuits involving chronic beryllium disease have been dismissed since July 1 
7759 The leading U.S. beryllium producer said in a conference call it has traditionally been pro-active regarding the workplace disease a lung ailment which can affects a small percent of people whose immune systems are susceptible 
7760 Of the 14 remaining suits 10 were filed by employees of industrial Brush Wellman customers and Brush Wellman liability in such suits is typically covered by insurance Timothy Reid vice president of corporate communications said on the call

7763 Brush Wellman has been a leader in dealing with health and safety issues related to chronic Beryllium disease for nearly 50 years he said 
7764 We have a record of going beyond regulatory requirements and we consistently share the most current information available with customers and employees

7834 Chelsea makes political debut on Clinton train trip 
7835 CHILLICOTHE Ohio 1996-08-25 
7836 Chelsea Clinton until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life made her political debut on Sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip 
7837 Chelsea 16 was at President Bill Clinton 's side as he rode the rails through parts of West Virginia Kentucky and Ohio and was introduced at every stop 
7838 She even worked ropelines shaking hands with excited fans 
7839 Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in Huntington West Virginia and then went on to Chicago to begin a rigorous Democratic Convention schedule 
7840 Asked if Chelsea would have a prominent role in the campaign White House spokesman Mike McCurry said She 'll do what she did today when she can 
7841 She has to go back to school 
7842 The president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at Sidwell Friends School a private school in Washington 
7843 McCurry said Chelsea has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career 
7844 Chelsea is a very poised young lady but she 's not that much interested in politics the spokesman said 
7845 Dutch closing share market report 
7846 AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26 
7847 Dutch shares drifted to a lower close on Monday dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the UK bank holiday and lack of any significant U.S. economic data 
7848 The AEX index of leading shares closed 4.54 points easier at 556.19 the day 's low 
7849 The Dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to Wall Street did little to boost sentiment in late trade dealers said 
7850 It was always going to be a tough day with participation so low 
7851 But the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds and that dragged us lower one dealer said 
7852 Stocks were down across the board with Dutch PTT topping the volume list and closing down 1.90 guilders at 58.70 
7853 The post and telecoms firm posted an 8.5 percent rise in first half earnings on Friday just below analysts expectations 
7854 IHC Caland reported first half results well under forecasts on Monday and the shares suffered as a result 
7855 They were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 2.40 guilders down at 80.70 after it reported net profits of 34.9 million guilders against 36.6 million last year and estimates ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 million 
7856 IHC also forecast post tax earnings rising 21 percent for the full year 
7857 Banking group ING traded ex-dividend today and finished 0.60 guilders weaker at 52.90 as a result 
7858 But Nutricia shrugged off its ex-div tag to soar a further 4.10 guilders to 214.40 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 51 percent jump in first half net profits last week which set the market alight on Friday sending the shares up 18.40 at 210.00 by the close 
7859 Engineering concern Stork started the day well as the shares attracted some follow-through interest to the announcement late on Friday that its Fokker Aviation unit had won a major order 
7860 But the rally was short-lived and Stork ended just 0.20 up at 51.00 guilders

7862 Tapie to quit French assembly seat as film opens 
7863 PARIS 1996-08-26 
7864 Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday the day a film by Claude Lelouche in which he stars opens in France 
7865 I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens he said in a broadcast interview 
7866 Just about he told Europe 1 radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin 
7867 A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received 
7868 Tapie 53 was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period 
7869 Tapie the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran has a starring role in Lelouche 's Homme femmes mode d'emploi Men women instructions for use 
7870 He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as a tender and cruel comedy by Lelouche who is making his 35th film 
7871 I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers Tapie said 
7872 In France you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time 
7873 That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens 
7874 Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament 
7875 The French procedure was expected to be completed before October 2 when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break but the European procedure was expected to take longer 
7876 Tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat 
7877 But such an appeal even if the court were to accept the case which it is not obliged to do would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him 
7878 Tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match 
7879 He is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court 
7880 Bank of France drains 3.9 bln Ffr at tender

7882 The Bank of France drained 3.9 billion francs at a securities repurchase tender held on Monday to allocate funds for injection into the money market on Tuesday 
7883 It accepted bids for 44.3 billion francs in new liquidity 3.9 billion less than the 48.2 billion leaving the market on Tuesday when a previous pact expires 
7884 The new pact expires on September 3 
7885 The Bank of France said it allocated 13.4 billion francs to bidders offering Treasury bills as collateral satisfying 3.4 percent of such demand 
7886 It allotted a further 30.9 billion to bidders putting up private paper satisfying 12.5 percent of this demand

7888 RABOBANK [ RABN.CN ] SEES H2 NET GROWTH UNDER 10 PCT 
7889 AMSTERDAM 1996-08-26 
7890 Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank Nederland BA 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 10 year percent in the second half of 1996 executive board chairman Herman Wijffels said on Monday 
7891 The unlisted bank earlier announced a 1996 interim net profit of 853 million guilders up 21.5 percent on the 702 million guilders reported in the first half of 1995 
7892 He said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans which was already easing and the performance of financial markets which were strong in the first half and boosted securities trading and underwriting income 
7893 We expect reasonable growth in the second half 
7894 Maybe it will be in single-digits Wijffels told Reuters 
7895 He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 50 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace 
7896 Rabobank 's net profit was 1.43 billion guilders in 1995 
7897 The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 1995 and increased investment 
7898 But Wijffels was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services

7921 BANGKOK 1996-08-26 
7922 Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa on Monday proposed September 18 as the date for parliamentary debate on an opposition no-confidence motion accusing him of incompetence 
7923 The president of parliament had earlier said September 11 could be set for the debate 
7924 The opposition motion against Banharn accuses him of being incompetent lacking ethical leadership and alleges his administration is corrupt 
7925 His critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate 
7926 Banharn has denied the accusations and said he is ready to clear himself in parliament 
7927 In my opinion September 18 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions 
7928 This has nothing to do with the accusation that I am trying to escape the debate Banharn told reporters after meeting coalition partners 
7929 Banharn 's 13-month-old six-party coalition government controls 209 seats in the 391-seat lower house of parliament 
7930 Political infighting within Banharn 's Chart Thai party has raised doubts whether he can hold his supporters together and defeat the opposition motion political analysts said 
7931 We are still waiting to fix a date 
7932 September 18 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda said an official at parliament 's agenda section

8013 FOCUS Eurobourses end mixed but London recovers 
8014 Leonard Santorelli 
8015 LONDON 1996-08-27 
8016 European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street hit by inflation worries 
8017 The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday 
8018 But it recovered at the close of trade 
8019 Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend slipping 0.3 percent but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground 
8020 Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week culminating in Friday 's trading high of 3,911 fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts 
8021 The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks 
8022 Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains 
8023 Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading said Alan Ackerman market strategist at Fahnestock & Co 
8024 Consequently stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings 
8025 Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe 
8026 Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent given a push by the performance of chemical shares 
8027 The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears it 's all company news said one trader 
8028 French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc dealers said 
8029 Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments 
8030 The dollar which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels 
8031 Besides the Tankan there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week said a UK bank corporate dealer 
8032 There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market 
8033 Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction 
8034 If it points to weakness in the economy the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate 
8035 The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent 
8036 The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe 's economic and monetary union EMU timetable 
8037 CURRENCIES 
8038 The dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of European trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on Monday 
8039 STOCK MARKETS 
8040 The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7 
8041 In Paris the CAC-40 share index finished down 2.43 at 2,017.99

8046 More hostages freed from hijacked Sudanese plane 
8047 STANSTED England 1996-08-27 
8048 Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between 60 and 70 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman authorities said 
8049 A spokesman for Stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association called Mr Sadiki and that police were trying to trace him 
8050 Police spokeswoman Kim White said police had already contacted Sadiki and were trying to arrange to bring him to Stansted 30 miles 48 km north-east of London to talk to the hijackers 
8051 The airport spokesman said the six hijackers who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives were believed to be Iraqi nationals 
8052 The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 10 starting with women and children in what police described as a controlled release 
8053 Police said most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis Jordanians Palestinians Syrians and Saudis 
8054 Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80 
8055 FEATURE Eco terrorists target UK builders 
8056 Edna Fernandes 
8057 LONDON 1996-08-27 
8058 Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts their profit margins 
8059 Described by one British company as eco-terrorism it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s 
8060 Famous names like Tarmac Plc Costain Group Plc and ARC a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc have all been targeted 
8061 Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless badly organised ragbag of students and hippies 
8062 You only have to see them in action at protests said David Harding spokesman at ARC Hanson 's aggregates company 
8063 They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation 
8064 One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal Building earlier this year If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare we will aim to drive them out of business 
8065 As well as financial threats companies also emphasise the terror tactics used 
8066 Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass which runs through a conservation area has led to violent protests delaying building bomb threats staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home 
8067 A Costain spokesman told Reuters We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house 
8068 But it 's when it gets to the employee families that it goes across the line 
8069 Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives are now the subject of a police investigation 
8070 Other larger activist groups include Earth First The Land is Ours Alarm UK and Road Alert 
8071 The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire 
8072 But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic pollution and damage local communities 
8073 The government has slashed its road-building spending 
8074 Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological 
8075 Graham Watts chief executive of the Construction Industry Council said I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project 
8076 But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago 
8077 There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now 
8078 He says the damage comes in two forms Tangible in the form of extra costs additional security threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity 
8079 Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract 
8080 I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss 
8081 ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself 
8082 Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass 
8083 It was called the First Battle of the Newbury bypass said ARC 's Harding 
8084 We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site 
8085 Hundreds of thousands of pounds dollars of damage was done in one day 
8086 Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future 
8087 Simon Brown analyst at investement bank UBS said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk 
8088 When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link through Twyford Down they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis 
8089 Harding says others have done the same 
8090 As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security 
8091 For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins overcapacity and stagnant demand eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe 
8092 London Carnival ends in high spirits 
8093 LONDON 1996-08-26 
8094 London 's annual Notting Hill Carnival the largest in Europe and second in the world only to Rio ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits 
8095 Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings 
8096 But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured 
8097 Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival now in its 31st year acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering 
8098 Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime

8110 Indonesia 's central bank suffered seven billion rupiah $ 2.9 million in losses resulting from fake transactions the Jakarta Post reported on Tuesday 
8111 A Bank Indonesia spokeswoman confirmed the newspaper report but declined to give further details 
8112 The bank 's governor Sudradjat Djiwandono was quoted as saying on Monday about 5.4 billion rupiah of the seven billion rupiah had been recovered 
8113 The newspaper said it was the central bank 's first public scandal in its 43-year history 
8114 The paper said five people had been arrested and police were looking for two more suspects

8116 GOLF PLAYERS DIVIDED ON CART REQUEST FOR OLAZABAL 
8117 NORTHAMPTON England 1996-08-27 
8118 Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are divided on whether Jose Maria Olazabal should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course 
8119 The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in Bordeaux France from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy 
8120 If the Tour 's tournament committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it said Ballesteros Olazabal 's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain 
8121 But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent 
8122 I know Olly 's situation is very unfortunate but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations he said 
8123 You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible 
8124 The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in Bordeaux he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's Ryder Cup

8139 He had been in charge for six months 
8140 Raith lost their first two games of the season away to Rangers and Celtic then crashed 3-0 at home to Motherwell on Saturday

8142 Regrettably Jimmy has felt unable to accept that offer and has accordingly left the club 
8143 Thomson said I am leaving with my dignity and my pride intact and that is very important to me 
8144 While not agreeing with the directors decision I respect their reasons for making it

8384 Larry Fine

8386 Stefan Edberg produced some of his vintage best on Tuesday to extend his grand run at the Grand Slams by toppling Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek in straight sets at the U.S. Open 
8387 Edberg competing in the 54th consecutive and final Grand Slam event of his illustrious career turned back the clock at Stadium Court with a flowing 6-3 6-3 6-3 serve-and-volley victory over the fifth-seeded Dutchman 
8388 It 's a win that I can be proud of said the 30-year-old Swede winner of two U.S. Opens and six Grand Slam titles in all 
8389 It 's never easy to beat the Wimbledon champion 
8390 Edberg who has said he will retire at season 's end made it look easy under gray skies at the National Tennis Centre 
8391 The unseeded Swede struck quickly breaking Krajicek in the first game and never let loose his grip on the one hour 44 minute match as he served and volleyed with the grace that made him one of the dominant players of his time 
8392 There 's not doubt about it Richard was definitely off his game and I took advantage said Edberg 
8393 I still have my days where I feel great out there 
8394 Also reaching the second round were top-seeded defending champion Pete Sampras a 6-2 6-2 6-1 winner over last minute replacement Jimy Szymanski of Venezuela called on after Adrian Voinea of Romania withdrew because of a sprained ankle

8553 VanLandingham 8-13 who entered the game with one complete game in the first 56 starts of his career limited the Phillies to two hits and two walks with four strikeouts 
8554 We 've been working all year on my follow-through and I really concentrated on that VanLandingham said 
8555 It gave me more life in all of my pitches so the ball moved more

8564 Trailing by a run entering the 11th the Orioles rallied against Oakland reliever Mark Acre 0-2 with a walk and a triple by Brady Anderson to tie the game 
8565 Then Oakland manager Art Howe decided to intentionally walk Rafael Palmeiro and Bobby Bonilla to load the bases but Acre was nowhere near the plate to Ripken 
8566 The decisive pitch nearly hit Ripken and gave the Orioles a one-half game lead over the Chicago White Sox in the wild-card race

8595 TENNIS CHANG WASHINGTON ADVANCE TWO WOMEN 'S SEEDS FALL 
8596 Larry Fine 
8597 NEW YORK 1996-08-26 
8598 Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day 
8599 Chang seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 8-6 in the tiebreaker 
8600 I was pretty tight the whole match conceded Chang one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish 
8601 Everyone has moments when they get tight 
8602 Hopefully this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament 
8603 Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington the 11th seed who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 7-5 6-1 
8604 Washington 's win was not comfortable either 
8605 The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami 
8606 Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi said Washington 
8607 Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate 
8608 Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall 
8609 Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany the sixth seed was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match 
8610 Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory 
8611 Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion Aleksandra Olsza of Poland removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2 
8612 Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round 
8613 Germany 's Michael Stich the 1991 Wimbledon champion and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 7-1 respectively 
8614 Alex O'Brien who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti 
8615 Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion 
8616 Tarango was leading 6-7 5-7 6-4 6-1 3-1 
8617 Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics 
8618 Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults 
8619 The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker 
8620 The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net 
8621 First Chang approached the umpire then Oncins then Chang again before play finally resumed 
8622 Those little seconds were like an hour to me said Oncins who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance 
8623 Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins the contest was a personal victory 
8624 The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 
8625 The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo 
8626 He died slumped against Oncins who subsequently lost interest in tennis 
8627 Two months ago I started talking about quitting said Oncins who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend 
8628 I believe in my game again he said 
8629 At the end of the day a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced 
8630 Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee and 1988 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull organisers said 
8631 Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist

8638 PARIS 1996-08-27 
8639 Former European champions Marseille held French champions Auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday 
8640 The bill looked promising but both sides struggling to find their form early in the season were disappointing 
8641 Auxerre who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam dominated the match but were unable to score 
8642 Unbeaten in four matches they still trail leaders Lens by one point 
8643 Lens who have won all their three league matches so far host Montpellier on Wednesday night 
8644 Despite another dismal performance especially in defence Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to Metz last Saturday 
8645 After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season some of whom do not speak a word of French Marseille are not playing with any fluidity 
8646 But German international goalkeeper Andreas Koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the Auxerre strikers saving his team with a number of fine parries 
8647 Marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points

8729 SOCCER NEUCHATEL TO APPEAL AGAINST CYPRIEN 'S NINE-MONTH BAN 
8730 GENEVA 1996-08-27 
8731 Swiss league leaders Neuchatel Xamax said on Tuesday they would appeal against a nine-month ban imposed on French international defender Jean-Pierre Cyprien for his part in a post-match brawl 
8732 Cyprien also fined 10,000 Swiss francs $ 8,400 traded punches with St Gallen 's Brazilian player Claudio Moura after a match on Saturday 
8733 When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene Cyprien launched a flying kick at Moura but only succeeded in kneeing St Gallen coach Roger Hegi in the stomach 
8734 Moura who appeared to have elbowed Cyprien in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by Neuchatel was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs $ 840 by the Swiss league disciplinary committee 
8735 Club president Gilbert Facchinetti said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal 
8736 Neuchatel coach Gilbert Gress described the incident as shocking but said Moura was also to blame 
8737 Moura physically and verbally provoked Cyprien during the match 
8738 The referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him Gress said 
8739 During the scuffle Moura threw the first punch 
8740 Tomorrow if someone punches me I would not know how to react 
8741 Cyprien who won his one French cap against Italy in February 1994 cannot play in Switzerland or elsewhere until May next year 
8742 CYCLING BUGNO CLEARED OF DOPING 
8743 MILAN 1996-08-27 
8744 Veteran Italian Gianni Bugno has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the Tour of Switzerland in June the Italian cycling federation said on Tuesday 
8745 He has been cleared 
8746 The case is closed a spokesman said 
8747 Bugno tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the Tour in which he finished third overall 
8748 But the spokesman said subsequent tests in Cologne proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally 
8749 Bugno who won the Giro d'Italia in 1990 and two successive world titles was banned for three months in 1994 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine

8774 COFINEC SLIPS ON BUDAPEST BOURSE BUT FUTURE STRONG 
8775 Emese Bartha 
8776 BUDAPEST 1996-08-27 
8777 Expectations that Cofinec S.A. the Hungarian bourse 's first foreign listing will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price but analysts expect a rebound in the long term 
8778 The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 1996 said Gabor Sitanyi a London-based analyst for ING Barings 
8779 The French-registered packaging materials company which floated its shares in Hungary in July for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering which was oversubscribed 
8780 The company which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 15 deadline for reporting first-half results closed on Tuesday at 5,800 forints down 300 
8781 Cofinec 's first-half figures will be 
8782 between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan said Tamas Erdei a Budapest-based analyst for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett 
8783 Analysts blame at least partly Hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which operating in Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from Hungary 
8784 Hungary 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 
8785 Both will have their impact on Cofinec 's figures the analysts said 
8786 Despite the current difficulties however analysts were convinced that Cofinec 's outlook was strong 
8787 The eastern European market offers good chances said Erdei 
8788 Just like many other companies on the bourse Cofinec has big growth opportunities 
8789 At the same time it 's an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better Erdei added 
8790 Cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected long-term Sitanyi said saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position 
8791 Among them he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company Krpaco a.s. increasing its ownership to 100 percent so in the second half the whole of Krpaco 's figures will be consolidated 
8792 The company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million 
8793 In addition its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned

8838 On Monday the company said it had agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc in a deal valued at $ 14 billion 
8839 MFS shares surged on the news while WorldCom fell on fears of dilution

8842 A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange would neither confirm or deny whether the exchange was looking into trading 
8843 If there is unusual activity certainly we look at it but that 's not to say we 're doing anything official he said 
8844 Pacific Stock Exchange officials were not available 
8845 One trader said trading in MFS options had increased steadily from about mid-August and doubted whether any of last Friday 's activity was insider trading

8854 McGrath left out of Ireland World Cup squad 
8855 DUBLIN 1996-08-27 
8856 Ireland 's most experienced player defender Paul McGrath was left out of the national squad for the first time in 11 years on Tuesday when new manager Mick McCarthy named his side to face Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier 
8857 The 36-year-old Aston Villa player won the last of his Irish record of 82 international caps against the Czech Republic in Prague in April 
8858 Paul accepted the situation 
8859 He has n't played any first-team games for Villa this season and he 's not the type of player I would have brought on as a substitute McCarthy said 
8860 But he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement 
8861 He 's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future 
8862 At 24 25 or 26 you could get away with it not having played first-team games 
8863 But at 36 it would be asking too much of Paul he said 
8864 Also omitted from the 20-man squad which will travel to Vaduz for Saturday 's group eight match are central defenders Alan Kernaghan and Liam Daish 
8865 Leeds United defender Gary Kelly is unable to travel because of a knee injury picked up in Monday 's 1-0 victory over Wimbledon at Elland Road 
8866 Since taking over from Jack Charlton in February McCarthy has played largely experimental sides and seen them lose five times draw twice and win just once

8871 South African apartheid killer Eugene de Kock was found guilty of murder and attempted murder on Tuesday a day after he was convicted of five other murders

8873 Sudanese rebels say missionaries should be freed 
8874 Peter Smerdon 
8875 NAIROBI 1996-08-27 
8876 The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries including three Australian nuns held for nearly two weeks 
8877 George Garang Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army SPLA said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six 
8878 The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free 
8879 This is a decision of the leadership Garang said 
8880 Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision 
8881 But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power he added 
8882 The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group 
8883 These charges are the interpretation of the church Garang said on Tuesday 
8884 We have no idea why they are being held 
8885 We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander 
8886 Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem 
8887 He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health 
8888 The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch 73 and Mary Batchelor 68 American Father Michael Barton 48 and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel 48 were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA 
8889 It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey 52 and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella 28 were held inside the compound 
8890 The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch Batchelor Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound 
8891 The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 
8892 But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed 
8893 It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition 
8894 On August 17 the mission was surrounded by the SPLA and sealed off 
8895 The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation 
8896 Later the mission was looted it added 
8897 An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were fairly bizarre and a matter for concern 
8898 He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries 
8899 The SPLA has fought Khartoum 's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem Arabised north 
8900 OSCE postpones Bosnian municipal elections 
8901 SARAJEVO 1996-08-27 
8902 The U.S. diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters 
8903 Ambassador Robert Frowick representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other Bosnian elections would be put off 
8904 I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 said Frowick 
8905 He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 
8906 According to OSCE officials Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control but which used to have Moslem majorities 
8907 Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement 
8908 Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war 
8909 The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear 
8910 But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed or go ahead with their own 
8911 The Bosnian Serb cabinet in a letter to the OSCE said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement 
8912 The Serbs who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections 
8913 Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned 
8914 New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin 
8915 Dmitry Kuznets 
8916 NOVYE ATAGI Russia 1996-08-27 
8917 Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed 
8918 The Russian army commander in the region General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi some 20 km 12 miles south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov 
8919 But Lebed himself the Kremlin security chief is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya 
8920 Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday would hold no working meetings on Tuesday 
8921 Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday saying he had to consult with Yeltsin 
8922 After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday 
8923 But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital 
8924 The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday 
8925 The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned 
8926 The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken 
8927 Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks 
8928 Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting which started around 10.45 a.m. 0645 GMT 
8929 Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning was Tim Guldimann the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE 
8930 Guldimann who helped broker an earlier truce in May was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks 
8931 Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict 
8932 However tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained 
8933 Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning 
8934 RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday 
8935 But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week would begin on Tuesday after delays for technical reasons 
8936 Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him 
8937 Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol 
8938 Yeltsin 65 has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll weakening his grip on affairs of state 
8939 Aides have dismissed such speculation insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign 
8940 Some analysts say the Kremlin leader whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 1994 started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart 
8941 But Lebed who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin 
8942 His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation 
8943 Slovenia and Poland target EU NATO membership 
8944 LJUBLJANA 1996-08-27 
8945 Slovenia and Poland pledged to intensify cooperation on Tuesday and reinforced their determination to join the European Union and NATO at the earliest possible date 
8946 Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and his Slovenian counterpart Milan Kucan met for talks at the start of a two-day visit to Slovenia by Kwasniewski 
8947 It was their fourth meeting this year 
8948 They said in a statement they agreed to have regular telephone contact to discuss progress in strengthening ties with the West 
8949 We expect our cooperation will help both countries towards entering the European Union and NATO Kwasniewski said 
8950 We have similar ambitions as far as our internal development and international life is concerned Kucan said 
8951 Poland and Slovenia are hoping to be among the first group of former eastern bloc countries to join the European Union and NATO 
8952 They have already signed an association agreement with the European Union and are both part of the Central European Free Trade Area which also comprises Hungary Slovakia and the Czech Republic 
8953 Slovenia 's trade with Poland rose to $ 142.3 million in 1995 from $ 118.8 million in 1994 
8954 During his visit to Slovenia Kwasniewski is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek representatives of Slovenian political parties and representatives of the Chamber of Economy 
8955 Nationalists want Iliescu ousted for Hungary pact 
8956 BUCHAREST 1996-08-27 
8957 Junior Nationalist members of Romania 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary 
8958 Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy the senior coalition partner immediately dismissed the National Unity Party PUNR demand as crude electioneering 
8959 It is a desperate move by the PUNR which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase 
8960 This treaty is both necessary and good Nastase said adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government 
8961 The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority 
8962 It will also boost both countries chances of admission to NATO and the European Union 
8963 If they the PUNR are so vexed they could leave the government 
8964 We might also help them to do it if they go on like this he said 
8965 The PUNR holds four key ministries justice transport agriculture and communications 
8966 PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu in power since the fall of communism in 1989 should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month 
8967 Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November 3 polls 
8968 His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed analysts said 
8969 Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons 
8970 Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for Iliescu 's impeachment 
8971 Estonian MPS see little hope of electing president 
8972 Belinda Goldsmith 
8973 TALLINN 1996-08-27 
8974 Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state 
8975 Neither Meri who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union nor his arch-rival former communist Arnold Ruutel have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament 
8976 Meri garnered 49 votes and Meri 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia 
8977 A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result 
8978 If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college 
8979 The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more Reform Party head Heiki Kranich told Reuters 
8980 Under a constitution agreed in 1992 a year after independence the president has no executive powers 
8981 His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis 
8982 But Meri 67 has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions 
8983 His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense 
8984 His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected scoring only 45 votes which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance 
8985 This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote 
8986 Support for Ruutel 68 remained constant at 34 votes 
8987 If the third vote fails to give either Meri or Ruutel 68 votes the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations 
8988 This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college 
8989 In its first presidential election in 1992 Meri won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against Ruutel 
8990 Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges 
8991 Estonia assembly fails to elect state president 
8992 TALLINN 1996-08-27 
8993 The Estonian parliament failed for a third and final time to elect a new state president on Tuesday refusing a second mandate for incumbent Lennart Meri 
8994 Neither Meri nor his rival Arnold Ruutel could garner the 68 votes needed from the 101 members of parliament to become president 
8995 In the third vote Meri won 52 and Ruutel won 32 votes 
8996 The final decision will now be made by a larger assembly 
8997 Meri won 49 in a second vote earlier on Tuesday and 45 in the first on Monday 
8998 Ruutel won 34 votes in the first two secret ballots 
8999 Enn Markvart chairman of the National Election Commission said 96 members of parliament cast votes with one ballot paper invalid and 11 abstentions 
9000 The election will now go before an electoral college involving MPs and local government representatives that will be convened by the parliamentary Speaker in the next day or so 
9001 It could take up to a month before a new vote but the timetable is not yet clear 
9002 This is the first time the former Soviet republic has had to convene such a group 
9003 Albania charges Briton with child sex abuse 
9004 TIRANA 1996-08-27 
9005 Albanian authorities have arrested and charged a British man for sexually abusing two young boys a Tirana prosecutor said on Tuesday 
9006 We have arrested him and charged him with these shameful acts of sex abuse of little children prosecutor Adnan Xhelili told Reuters 
9007 Xhelili said Paul Thompson 34 from Wiltshire was arrested on Sunday in a hotel in the Adriatic resort of Durres 45 km 30 miles west of Tirana 
9008 Thompson has denied the charges 
9009 He could face up to five years in jail if convicted 
9010 Xhelili said Thompson who is divorced said he befriended the boys both aged under 10 because they reminded him of his own children who live with his former wife in London 
9011 The prosecutor 's office said no date had yet been set for a trial to begin as investigations had first to be completed 
9012 The British embassy in Tirana said it had sent an embassy official to talk to Thompson who is being held in jail 
9013 The age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual sex in Albania is 14 
9014 A large number of destitute children can be seen begging in the streets of impoverished Albania especially in towns and resorts visited by foreigners 
9015 Estonia assembly again fails to elect president 
9016 TALLINN 1996-08-27 
9017 Estonia 's parliament again failed to elect a new state president on Tuesday when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting 
9018 Incumbent president Lennart Meri won 49 votes compared to 34 won by his rival deputy Parliamentary Speaker Arnold Ruutel 
9019 But Meri 's support was not enough for the 68 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day 1300 GMT parliamentary officials said 
9020 To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term a candidate must secure 68 votes from the 101-member parliament 
9021 Enn Markvart Chairman of the National Election Commission said 96 members of parliament voted in the second round with 12 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid 
9022 On Monday in the first round of voting Meri secured 45 votes and Ruutel 34 
9023 Meri 's popularity has suffered in recent years with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament 
9024 If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 68 votes the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 101 MPs and 273 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month

9026 Peter Laca 
9027 BRATISLAVA 1996-08-27 
9028 Marc Dutroux the chief accused in Belgium 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case visited Slovakia a number of times and about 10 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation police said on Tuesday 
9029 But they have difficulty remembering what happened there perhaps because of drugs and are unsure whether they were filmed for pornography Rudolf Gajdos head of the Slovak office of Interpol told Reuters 
9030 Although Gajdos spoke of girls his deputy Eva Boudova said the case involved about 10 young women in their early 20s 
9031 The police interrogated several Slovak girls who said that they had been invited by Mark Dutroux to visit Belgium Gajdos said 
9032 The girls said they went to Belgium voluntarily and the police suspect that they were used to act in pornographic films 
9033 The police suspect the girls were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills 
9034 We have suspicions of a rape but the police still have to find the victim Gajdos added 
9035 Dutroux 's last visit to Slovakia was reported to have been as recent as July 
9036 Slovak police are also cooperating with Belgium in the search for An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks who went missing last August 
9037 Dutroux 39 who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two other girls aged 14 and 12 is one of several suspects in the Marchal and Lambrecks case 
9038 Last Saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls aged eight who died of starvation this year after their abduction in June 1995 
9039 The Czech office of Interpol said on Friday it would neither confirm nor deny that Dutroux had been in the Czech Republic Slovakia 's western neighbour and former federation partner 
9040 Belgian police said an officer had visited Bratislava to talk with Slovak detectives about An and Eefje and other disappearances and he planned to go also to Prague

9051 Russian army Chechens open new round of talks 
9052 MOSCOW 1996-08-27 
9053 Russia 's military commander in Chechnya began new talks with separatist chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov on Tuesday Itar-Tass news agency said 
9054 Tass said the talks were taking place in the settlement of Novye Atagi some 20 km 12 miles south of the Chechen capital Grozny

9060 BUENOS AIRES Argentina 1996-08-27 
9061 The Archbishop of Buenos Aires said on Tuesday the first thing he would do if elected president of Argentina would be to put up posters of the Ten Commandments in government offices 
9062 They asked me what would be the first thing I would do if I were president and I said the first thing I would do would be to resign straight away Archbishop Antonio Quarracino said at a sermon attended by several cabinet ministers 
9063 But before going I would have big signs put up in all government offices those to do with justice in all sectors with the Ten Commandments he added 
9064 Argentina 's top Roman Catholic cleric said the Biblical commandment Thou shalt not steal would get special emphasis because it has to be about the most common thing these days 
9065 Quarracino and other Church leaders are regular critics of the government 's free-market economic policy

9071 Dutch government wo n't pay ransom for kidnap victims 
9072 SAN JOSE Costa Rica 1996-08-27 
9073 The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a Dutch couple kidnapped from their farm while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case 
9074 We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters 
9075 Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife Jetsi Hendrika Coers both 50 were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom authorities said 
9076 Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple 
9077 Anton Schutte an official with the embassy for Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom 
9078 We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell Schutte added 
9079 A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car which was used in the kidnapping Schutte told a news conference on Monday 
9080 He said the note believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims was addressed to Ebe Huizinga another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation 
9081 Depending on you we will either live or die it said 
9082 Alvarado said the car was abandoned about 40 miles 60 km north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring Nicaragua 
9083 The farm is in the border region where a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former Nicaraguan guerrilla 
9084 The two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom 
9085 Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested

9098 MANAGUA Nicaragua 1996-08-27 
9099 Heavy drinkers in a Nicaraguan city were searching for someone who has covered them in lovebites while they were passed out in a drunken stupor a local newspaper reported on Tuesday 
9100 The dreaded chupabolos drunksucker preys on men who have passed out in the streets of Matagalpa 80 miles 130 kms north of Managua placing hickey-like lovebites on various parts of their bodies El Nuevo Diario reported 
9101 Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market

9106 Brazil likely to turn Banespa federal bank paper 
9107 SAO PAULO 1996-08-27 
9108 Brazil is likely to turn Sao Paulo state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization according to unnamed government sources O Globo daily said 
9109 The newspaper said the Central Bank special administration of Banespa ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to Sao Paulo state government 
9110 A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report 
9111 Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 
9112 The central bank management could be lifted if Sao Paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks 
9113 Under the plan the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized liquidated or turned into development banks 
9114 It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks 
9115 Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because Sao Paulo 's debt with Banespa has increased sharply O Globo said 
9116 Sao Paulo state 's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais 
9117 O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus 
9118 The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank TBC 
9119 O Globo also said the loan would give Bamerindus time to sell assets 
9120 Bamerindus Brazil 's fourth-largest private bank has been facing liquidity troubles 
9121 Bamerindus declined to comment on negotiations being held with the Central Bank

9129 Former Argentine benevolent dictator Alejandro Lanusse dies 
9130 BUENOS AIRES 1996-08-26 
9131 Alejandro Lanusse the former dictator who ruled Argentina for two years died at age 78 on Monday 
9132 Lanusse died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain 
9133 He was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery 
9134 The former dictator who ruled from 1971 to 1973 was best known for allowing Juan Domingo Peron Argentina 's famed populist leader to return to Argentina after 17 years of forced exile 
9135 Lanusse took over the leadership of the country after five years of dictatorship 
9136 But unlike his two predecessors Juan Carlos Ongania and Marcelo Levingston who ruled Argentina with an iron hand Lanusse steered the country toward democracy 
9137 That resulted in general elections in March 1973 when the Peronists led by Hector Campora and Vicente Solano Lima returned to power 
9138 Lanusse was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office 
9139 He was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow Peron led by General Benjamin Menendez 
9140 Lanusse 's rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal Argentine dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 during which the military launched its dirty war that resulted in 10,000 missing people 
9141 In his autobiography published in 1990 Lanusse described himself as a military man with democratic ideas 
9142 He was born in Buenos Aires in 1918 and married Ileana Bell with whom he had nine children 
9143 He entered the Military College in 1935

9183 New U.N. relief coordinator arrives in Iraq 
9184 Leon Barkho 
9185 BAGHDAD 1996-08-27 
9186 A new U.N. relief coordinator has arrived in Baghdad to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face Iraq 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved 
9187 U.N. and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari 
9188 One diplomat said Iraq and U.N. were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under Baghdad 's oil deal with U.N 
9189 The United Nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors 
9190 Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens said the diplomat 
9191 Baghdad holds that the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in Iraq 
9192 Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them said another diplomat 
9193 Iraq 's partial oil sales pact with U.N. allowing crude exports worth $ 2 billion every six months gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country 
9194 The deal is a humanitarian exception to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports 
9195 Fulcheri declined comment on the differences between the U.N. and Iraq saying only There are several different things which still need to be done 
9196 Fulcheri started his U.N. career in 1960 and has long experience in U.N. emergency relief in Congo Angola Sudan and Somalia

9204 Anti-abortion speaker praises Democrat tolerance 
9205 Alan Elsner 
9206 CHICAGO 1996-08-27 
9207 An anti-abortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views 
9208 Rep 
9209 Tony Hall of Ohio said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party 
9210 But this year is different 
9211 For the first time the Democratic Party has included in our platform a conscience clause he said 
9212 The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party 
9213 The Democratic Party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness Hall said 
9214 At its convention four years ago organizers prevented then Pennsylvania Gov 
9215 Robert Casey a vehement opponent of abortion from speaking 
9216 Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since 
9217 Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down 
9218 Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak 
9219 I believe the Democratic party ought to be pro-woman pro-child and pro-life Casey said 
9220 I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention 
9221 For the second time in four years my request fell on deaf ears he said 
9222 The Republican Party whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal faced a similar dilemma this year when Massachusetts Gov 
9223 William Weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down 
9224 Bob Dole the Republican presidential nominee tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights 
9225 Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights 
9226 Kate Michelman president of the National Abortion Rights Action League described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children 
9227 I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth 
9228 The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain 
9229 Their answer to choice is control and punishment 
9230 Our answer is trust compassion and respect she said 
9231 Georgia Rep 
9232 Cynthia McKinney said You make your moral decisions 
9233 I 'll make mine and let 's leave Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich out of it 
9234 U.S. Spring White Wheat Bids mostly steady 
9235 CHICAGO 1996-08-27 
9236 Dark northern spring and white wheat bids were mostly steady on Tuesday but a few locations quoted weaker values as newly harvested spring wheat flooded the market several cash grain dealers said

9238 Bids there dropped 10 cents per bushel 
9239 Harvest was also progressing well in parts of North Dakota but one dealer there said new crop movement remained limited to a steady trickle 
9240 We 're seeing some new crop coming in now but it 's slow going the dealer said 
9241 Elsewhere basis values were mostly steady in quiet conditions with little noteworty domestic or export business dealers said

9301 CHICAGO 1996-08-27 
9302 An ABC News poll released on Tuesday showed President Bill Clinton 's lead over Republican challenger Bob Dole stretching to 15 points in advance of the Nov. 5 election 
9303 The poll taken on Sunday and Monday as the president engaged in a whistle-stop train trip to the Democratic Convention in Chicago put Clinton at 51 percent Dole at 36 percent and Ross Perot of the Reform Party at 8 percent 
9304 A similar poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday had showed a nine point lead for Clinton ahead by 47-38 percent 
9305 Dole down by around 20 points in early August in ABC polls had closed to within four percentage points immediately after the Republican convention in San Diego earlier in August 
9306 Other polls also showed a strong Dole bounce after San Diego but Clinton then rebuilding his lead 
9307 Tuesday 's poll involved 1,002 registered voters and had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points 
9308 ABC said a parallel poll of 824 likely voters showed the president ahead by 11 points with Clinton at 50 percent Dole at 39 percent and Perot at 6 percent 
9309 The poll of registered voters showed a shift in favor of the Democrats in the elections for House of Representatives with 51 percent saying that if the vote were today they would go for a Democrat and 41 percent opting for a Republican 
9310 That compared with the previous poll 's 48-43 lead for the Democrats 
9311 The poll gave Clinton a 53 percent to 39 percent lead over Dole if Perot were not in the race 
9312 The poll indicated a fall in the number of people who believed Dole would be able to fulfil his promise to cut the federal budget deficit and cut income taxes by 15 percent at the same time 
9313 It showed 23 percent believed it possible compared to 70 who believed it was n't 
9314 That compared to 26-57 in the previous poll

9421 Mother Teresa spent her 86th birthday in a Calcutta hospital bed on Tuesday as tributes to the legendary missionary poured in from around the world 
9422 Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days

9424 She is conscious but her breathing is irregular

9426 She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria 
9427 Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control but her heart continues to beat irregularly doctors said 
9428 Unless she breathes on her own I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa

9437 She is like a goddess said Raju 8 who has a mother but no father 
9438 The Statesman newspaper quoted 40-year-old Mangala Das paralysed from her waist down and a resident of the Prem Dan Gift of Love home for the destitute as saying she and her friends had been praying incessantly for Mother Teresa 's recovery 
9439 Tarak Das 70 was picked up from a Calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to Nirmal Hriday Immaculate Home 
9440 I do not know who she is 
9441 I have never seen her but I can only bless her for what she has done for people like me Das told The Statesman 
9442 Mother Teresa 's condition improved on Sunday as her fever abated and on Monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns

9448 British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday that his government would only take action against a planned conference of Islamist groups in London if British law was broken 
9449 People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain Rifkind in Pakistan for a visit told Reuters 
9450 As long as they obey our laws then that is not something the government would normally interfere with 
9451 The Islamist conference due to be held in London on September 8 has caused concern in countries such as Algeria and Egypt which are fighting armed Islamic militants 
9452 British Jewish groups have also protested because they say members of Algeria 's Islamic Salvation Front FIS and the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas are on the guest list 
9453 Rifkind said it was for the home secretary interior minister to act by denying visas to participants if he felt there was reason to believe that they might break the law 
9454 Our policy has to be fundamentally based on respect for the rule of law and insistence that it be observed he said 
9455 Rifkind was in Pakistan at the start of an Asian tour that will also take him to India Sri Lanka Japan and Mongolia 
9456 Afghan leader tells U.S. Congressman of peace plan

9458 KABUL 1996-08-27 
9459 Afghan government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood briefed visiting U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher on Tuesday on a peace plan for his wartorn country 
9460 A spokesman for Masood said he had told the California Republican at a meeting in northern Kabul that President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government favoured talks with all Afghan factions to set up an interim government 
9461 The factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader draft a new constitution collect heavy weapons create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing he added 
9462 Rohrabacher flew into Bagram military airbase north of Kabul in a Red Cross plane on Tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum 
9463 Masood 's spokesman Amrollah one name said Rohrabacher had recently visited Italy Saudi Arabia and Pakistan as part of a mission to promote peace in Afghanistan 
9464 We are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the Afghan problem and support every U.N. plan Amrollah quoted Rohrabacher as saying 
9465 However a spokesman for Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar a long-time rival of Masood expressed concern at signs of renewed U.S. interest in Afghanistan 
9466 America wants to block the establishment of a strong Islamic government in Afghanistan and the U.S. intends to neutralise the Afghan peace process initiated by the Afghans themselves said the spokesman Hamid Ibrahimi 
9467 A great game has been started in Afghanistan as America feels that Tehran and Moscow have got stronger in the Afghan picture something Washington wants to change he said 
9468 Rohrabacher was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of Jalalabad and meet leaders of the rebel Islamic Taleban militia in the southern city of Kandahar 
9469 Afghan guerrilla factions have been locked in a bloody power struggle since the fall of the communist government in April 1992

9682 CHICAGO 1996-08-26 
9683 Sarah Brady whose Republican husband was severely disabled in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan took centre stage at the Democratic National convention on Monday night to praise President Bill Clinton 's gun control efforts 
9684 With her husband James sitting in a wheelchair to the side of the podium Mrs. Brady called the handgun control bill that a Democratic Congress passed and Clinton signed in 1994 a major step in controlling firearm violence in the United States 
9685 But she said more had to be done 
9686 The Bradys walked on to the stage he on her arm and with the aid of a cane to a rousing reception from the convention 
9687 Their teenaged son sat in a VIP box with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and watched as his father returned to his wheelchair 
9688 Jim we must have made a wrong turn 
9689 This is n't San Diego site of the Republican convention Mrs. Brady joked to her husband who was serving as Reagan 's press secretary when he was shot 
9690 Sarah I told you this is the Democratic convention he responded to his wife who before the shooting had worked for two Republican congressmen and the Republican national party 
9691 Since the Brady Law went into effect on February 28 1994 it has stopped more than 100,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun 
9692 Today and every day the Brady Law is stopping an estimated 85 felons from buying a handgun Mrs. Brady said 
9693 She added But we need to do more 
9694 We should as President Clinton proposed today stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun 
9695 Jim and I join with you tonight in saluting the great job that President Clinton has done in fighting crime and gun violence 
9696 He 's a hunter and a sportsman but he understands the difference between a Remington rifle and an AK47 
9697 And he knows that you do n't go hunting with an Uzi 
9698 Mr. President you deserve our thanks

9751 A hijacked Sudan Airways plane carrying 199 passengers and crew landed at Stansted airport just outside London early on Tuesday morning after flying from Cyprus eyewitnesses said 
9752 The Airbus 310 Flight 150 which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman landed at 4.30 a.m. 0330 GMT after a flight of more than four hours 
9753 At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in Cyprus unless it was refuelled so they could fly to Britain to claim political asylum 
9754 They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Cyprus 's Larnaca airport 
9755 Security was tight at Stansted airport which is about 30 miles 50 km northeast of the capital 
9756 Stansted has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern England because it is more remote than Heathrow and Gatwick London 's two major airports and handles less air traffic 
9757 Hijacked Sudan plane expected at London 's Stansted 
9758 LONDON 1996-08-27 
9759 A hijacked Sudan Airways plane with 199 passengers and crew on board was expected to land at London 's Stansted airport later on Tuesday morning a police spokeswoman said 
9760 That is the plan at the moment 
9761 That is where the plane is being directed to Ruth Collin of Essex police the force responsible for Stansted said 
9762 Stansted London 's third-busiest airport after Heathrow and Gatwick is located about 30 miles 48 km northeast of the capital 
9763 British officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at Stansted because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at Heathrow or Gatwick 
9764 They said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking 
9765 The armed hijackers of the Airbus 310 Flight 150 which is expected to arrive about 4 a.m. 0300 GMT have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in Britain 
9766 The plane was hijacked on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday evening and landed at Larnaca airport in Cyprus to refuel 
9767 The identity and number of the hijackers was not known 
9768 One of them negotiated through the pilot in English 
9769 The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane 
9770 Painted parrot scam lands Australian in jail 
9771 PERTH Australia 1996-08-27 
9772 A conman who painted common Australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday 
9773 Denham Peiris painted six green parrots worth about A$ 100 US$ 79 a pair with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as Indian Ringneck Parrots valued at A$ 14,000 a pair 
9774 Peiris 32 of Perth was sentenced in the Western Australian District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 21 parrots worth a total of A$ 28,000 
9775 Everyone was fooled said pet shop owner Shane Drew who unknowingly traded the disguised birds 
9776 I 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication they said they 're nice birds Drew told reporters outside court 
9777 After I was told they were dyed I checked them over again 
9778 It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed Drew said 
9779 Drew said Peiris a bird enthusiast would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam 
9780 If not for the informant the painted parrots true colours would not have been known for six months he said 
9781 They moult in the summer so five or six months down the track I would have looked like the guilty party Drew said

9788 The man was due to catch a flight to Nuku'alofa in Tonga later on Tuesday

9796 Seoul embassies warned of terrorist attacks 
9797 SEOUL 1996-08-27 
9798 South Korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former Yugoslavia received a threat over Seoul 's crackdown on radical students the foreign ministry said on Tuesday 
9799 A letter to the Belgrade embassy on Monday under the name of the Macedonian Communist Party demanded South Korea release detained student leaders a ministry spokesman said 
9800 The letter said the party would assault the embassy other South Korean-related facilities and Korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students he said 
9801 Nearly 400 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist North Korea were crushed by riot police at a Seoul university this month 
9802 Authorities branded the violence in which a police officer was killed as an act of terror 
9803 The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks the official said asking not to be named 
9804 It had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions including those in Canada and Bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown 
9805 Nuclear pact will be a step to disarmament-China 
9806 BEIJING 1996-08-27 
9807 China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament 
9808 Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country it was in general balanced the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary 
9809 India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament 
9810 New Delhi 's stance which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism 
9811 India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly 
9812 China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations 
9813 The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament it said 
9814 China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord 
9815 The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance 
9816 Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons it said 
9817 China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day 
9818 China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing 
9819 Japan declares food poisoning threat receding 
9820 TOKYO 1996-08-27 
9821 The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ while still requiring vigilance appears to be receding in the western Japan city of Sakai where the epidemic hit the hardest 
9822 The food poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 colon bacillus in Sakai appears to be settling down Health Minister Naoto Kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet 
9823 The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year 
9824 Sakai near the regional commercial centre of Osaka has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria with nearly 6,500 mostly schoolchildren affected by the disease 
9825 Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria 
9826 Kan told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 8 indicating that the peak has passed at least for Sakai 
9827 Sakai officials agreed with the assessment but said it was too early to feel relieved 
9828 There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with a city spokesman said citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September 
9829 Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection 
9830 The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme 
9831 The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October when schools around the country resume 
9832 Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic 
9833 As of Monday 31 children were still hospitalised in Sakai city of whom six were in serious condition 
9834 Japan aluminium shipments surge 8.9 pct in July 
9835 TOKYO 1996-08-27 
9836 Japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged 8.9 percent over the same month last year to 224,609 tonnes while production rose 6.4 percent to 222,457 tonnes according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the Japan Aluminium Federation 
9837 The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors federation officials said 
9838 Figures released two weeks ago from Japan 's seven largest mills already showed that Japan 's can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in July reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption 
9839 A federation official added that the half-year through September 1996 also appeared likely to set a new record for can production despite cooler temperatures in August 
9840 July inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes down 2.6 percent from the prior month 
9841 July foil output was off 0.2 percent year-on-year at 11,525 tonnes while foil shipments fell 0.8 percent to 11,244 tonnes 
9842 June mill output data were revised slightly downward to 210,622 tonnes from the preliminary 210,683 while shipments were revised marginally upward to 213,989 tonnes from 213,845 
9843 Final figures for June pegged can stock shipments at 40,144 tonnes up 2.4 percent year-on-year 
9844 Shipments to the auto sector fell 5.5 percent to 15,286 tonnes while the construction sector rose 2.4 percent to 79,390 tonnes 
9845 Exports dipped 3.7 percent to 18,867 tonnes

9847 China thanks Gabon for support on human rights 
9848 BEIJING 1996-08-27 
9849 China has publicly thanked Gabon for its strong support at the United Nations Human Rights Commission where Beijing has come under attack from Western nations for its human rights record 
9850 China 's President Jiang Zemin offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting Gabon President Omar Bongo the official Xinhua news agency said 
9851 Jiang also acknowledged the Central African nation 's support for China 's stance on Taiwan which Beijing views as a renegade province while Bongo was quoted as thanking China for economic and technological aid the agency said late on Monday 
9852 In April China quashed a draft resolution by the U.N. Human Rights Commission expressing concern over continuing reports of Beijing 's violations of fundamental freedoms 
9853 After the defeat of the resolution drafted by the European Union and the United States China 's Foreign Ministry thanked 26 countries for backing its motion for no action on the document 
9854 It was the sixth year in a row that China avoided censure at the U.N. 's main human rights forum 
9855 China has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses often in violation of its own legal code in an effort to silence dissent 
9856 A Xinhua commentary earlier this year said a plot by the West to force its human rights standards and values on other countries was doomed to failure 
9857 Taiwan 's Cooperative Bank cuts prime lending rate 
9858 TAIPEI 1996-08-27 
9859 Cooperative Bank of Taiwan one of the island 's leading state-run banks said it was cutting its prime lending rate by 0.05 percentage point effective on Tuesday 
9860 The bank said in a statement it was cutting its prime lending rate to 7.35 percent from 7.40 percent 
9861 It also would cut its three-month-to-three-year time deposit rates by between 0.05 and 0.10 percentage points 
9862 The moves made Cooperative the first major bank to cut rates in response to a call on Friday from central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong 
9863 In the central bank 's latest bid to jumpstart Taiwan 's sluggish economy Sheu ordered a reduction of up to a half-percentage point in banks reserve requirements and called on commercial banks to pass on the savings in the form of interest rate reductions

9865 Palestinians to strike over Jerusalem demolition 
9866 JERUSALEM 1996-08-27 
9867 Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem called on Tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called Israel 's war on Arab East Jerusalem after police demolished a building there 
9868 Israeli police demolished a 10 metre yard by 20 metre structure in Jerusalem 's Old City they said had been built with funding from the Palestinian self-rule Authority for use as a social club 
9869 Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the Old City 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys witnesses said 
9870 Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 1991 and it had yet to be completed when the Israeli police bulldozed it 
9871 The Palestinian Authority was set up under the 1993 PLO-Israel interim peace deal 
9872 There has been a call for a general strike between one 1000 GMT and three o'clock Palestinian lawmaker Ahmed Hashem Zighayer told Reuters 
9873 This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war 
9874 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government which took office in June has said it will not allow the Authority set up under a 1993 interim peace deal to control parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank to operate in Jerusalem 
9875 Israel 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to Palestinian Authority activity in the city 
9876 Tuesday 's demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu 's demand they close offices in Jerusalem 
9877 They said two of the three offices Israel wanted closed had been shut 
9878 Netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO 
9879 Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it 
9880 It says it will never cede any part of the city 
9881 Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state 
9882 The city is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu 
9883 SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices 
9884 WASHINGTON 1996-08-28 
9885 The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders 
9886 The so-called order handling rules which were proposed last September were approved in a 4-0 vote 
9887 The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them 
9888 The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time 
9889 Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock 
9890 In a limit order investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices 
9891 These rules are intended to empower all investors by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt 
9892 The SEC 's goal he added was to create one system where one price could be available to everybody 
9893 The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation Richard Lindsey said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules 
9894 In proposing the rules last year the SEC noted that while technology has improved commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors best interests 
9895 It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market 
9896 It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems thus robbing investors without access to hidden quotes the benefit of the best available prices 
9897 Earlier this month the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market the National Association of Securities Dealers agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers trading practices 
9898 The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed 
9899 The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the price improvement proposal again 
9900 The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous bid and ask quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq 
9901 The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq where such orders have never been displayed 
9902 The president of the Nasdaq Alfred Berkeley was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules effects on the market the second largest in the world 
9903 ITALIAN CABINET APPROVES TELEVISION DECREE 
9904 ROME 1996-08-28 
9905 The Italian cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul Silvio Berlusconi 's Mediaset television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until January 31 1997 
9906 The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels 
9907 Passengers injured in train collision in Linz 
9908 LINZ Austria 1996-08-28 
9909 A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in Linz on Wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured 
9910 Austrian television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in Linz 300 km 180 miles west of Vienna 
9911 One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it a police spokesman in Linz told Reuters by telephone 
9912 The express passenger train travelling from Steyr southeast of Linz with around 80 people on board hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings 
9913 The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage 
9914 Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly he added 
9915 Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency APA 
9916 Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market 
9917 WINNIPEG 1996-08-28 
9918 Canada 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production 
9919 Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement 
9920 SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 
9921 The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie 
9922 Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie 
9923 SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework 
9924 Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs

10121 CYCLING BOARDMAN FULFILS WORLD RECORD PREDICTION 
10122 Martin Ayres 
10123 MANCHESTER England 1996-08-28 
10124 Britain 's Chris Boardman fulfilled his prediction that he would break the world 4,000 metres world record in the world track cycling championships on Wednesday 
10125 Boardman clocked four minutes 13.353 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 4:19.699 set by Olympic champion Andrea Collinelli of Italy in Atlanta in July 
10126 Collinelli qualified in second place also beating his old record in 4:17.696 
10127 I was very nervous before the start but then I was amazed by the speed of my ride Boardman said 
10128 I do n't know if I can go any faster 
10129 Who knows what will happen in the later stages ? 
10130 Boardman 28 did not contest the Olympic pursuit because of its proximity to the Tour de France in which he led the French GAN team 
10131 However he took a bronze medal in the Olympic road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the Manchester indoor velodrome 
10132 He adopted the superman riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow Briton Graeme Obree the 1995 world champion and taken up in Atlanta by Collinelli 
10133 Obree was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection

10194 They had some scans and X-rays yesterday and they 're out said Hoddle 
10195 The more important thing for me was to get them down here and have a chat 
10196 To go another five weeks without that chance would have been foolish he added 
10197 Hoddle who has already lost the services of midfielder Darren Anderton and defender Steve Howey delayed naming any replacements 
10198 There was also concern over injuries to Paul Gascoigne Les Ferdinand and David Batty

10211 But he has had second thoughts since then 
10212 I 'm only 34 
10213 Some say that 's too old for an athlete he said 
10214 But I 'll be 38 by Sydney and that 's not too old 
10215 It 's whether I have got the enthusiasm for the training over the next four years 
10216 Rowing is an endurance sport

10334 TENNIS SERIOUS MEDVEDEV IS HAVING FUN AGAIN 
10335 Richard Finn 
10336 NEW YORK 1996-08-28 
10337 Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again 
10338 I think I 'm much more focused on what I have to do and that 's playing tennis Medvedev said after routing Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian 6-2 6-0 6-1 in the opening round of the U.S. Open 
10339 It was Medvedev 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup 
10340 I realised this year that without putting 99.9 percent of your mind into tennis I do n't think you can successful said the 22-year-old Medvedev 
10341 The whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis 
10342 I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before they were distracting me they were not helping me at all 
10343 For Medvedev that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand 
10344 I know what I 'm here for said Medvedev who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in 1993 the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic 
10345 I 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court 
10346 I 'm here to play tennis and to win 
10347 I have much less fun off the court 
10348 I have much more fun on the court he said 
10349 Just three years ago Medvedev was one of the world 's best with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments 
10350 But Medvedev 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury 
10351 The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago 
10352 It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long Medvedev said of his current ranking of 36 
10353 It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept 
10354 As part of his new businesslike approach Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off 
10355 At the beginning of the year we started from zero said Medvedev 
10356 Winning in Long Island last week was like winning for the first time 
10357 While Medvedev 's 77-minute romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable 
10358 In the original draw Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other 
10359 When controversy forced the draw to be done over against odds of 151-to-1 Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time 
10360 When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation Medvedev said 
10361 I think it 's destined that it turned out for me

10485 TENNIS GRAF WORKS HARD FOR FIRST-ROUND WIN 
10486 Bill Berkrot 
10487 NEW YORK 1996-08-27 
10488 It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night 
10489 But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon 
10490 Graf of course prevailed 6-3 7-6 but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets 
10491 I won the second set which I did n't think I would do being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 Graf recalled 
10492 Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graf-like efficiency Tuesday 
10493 As afternoon turned to evening fourth-seeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games one more than second seed Monica Seles who opened the second-day programme by crushing American Anne Miller 6-0 6-1 
10494 Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the 1994 champion and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round 
10495 But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side 
10496 Fifth-seed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan the 10th seed fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked American Kimberly Po 
10497 Date 's defeat left no other seeded players in Seles 's quarter of the draw which lost Anke Huber 6 and Maggie Maleeva 12 on Monday 
10498 But Graf winner of 20 Grand Slam titles was not about to join that list 
10499 At some points I felt a little nervous she admitted 
10500 When it came down to the important points I felt more confident 
10501 Basuki a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year was clearly going for winners hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead 
10502 Graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order 
10503 But Basuki her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots held her serve and twice had set point on Graf 's serve at 6-5 before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break 
10504 I lost the moment lamented Basuki who has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in Montreal earlier this month 
10505 Still the feisty Indonesian got off to a 3-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave Graf her chance to avoid a third set 
10506 Usually in the first one or two matches you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it said Graf who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker 
10507 To be in that situation today a couple of times having to play well get down and play point-by-point definitely is a good start 
10508 BASEBALL SOSA HAS SURGERY OUT UP TO SIX WEEKS 
10509 CHICAGO 1996-08-27 
10510 Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa underwent surgery on Monday to remove a fractured bone from his right hand and will miss four to six weeks the club announced Tuesday 
10511 Sosa a leading candidate for National League Most Valuable Player honours was injured August 20th when he was hit by a Mark Hutton pitch in the first inning of an 8-1 victory over the Florida Marlins 
10512 The 27-year-old Sosa leads the league with 40 homers and is tied for 10th with 100 RBI 
10513 The loss of Sosa who appeared in all 124 games this season is a huge blow to the Cubs playoff hopes 
10514 SOCCER MARCELO HAT-TRICK KEEPS PSV AT TOP OF DUTCH LEAGUE 
10515 AMSTERDAM 1996-08-28 
10516 Brazilian striker Marcelo scored a hat-trick as PSV Eindhoven maintained their 100 percent record and stayed on top of the Dutch first division with a 3-1 win at Volendam on Wednesday 
10517 PSV 's main rivals for the title defending champions Ajax Amsterdam celebrated the novelty of having the roof of their new 51,000 seat stadium closed against the rain with a 1-0 win over AZ Alkmaar 
10518 Ajax were missing six first-team players but Frank de Boer shot home the winner from a 20-metre free kick in the 30th minute of a dull game 
10519 Marcelo signed in close season to replace compatriot Ronaldo who left to play for Barcelona opened the PSV scoring in the 19th minute when he fired home after good work from Rene Eijkelkamp 
10520 The Brazilian found the mark again two minutes after halftime and again in the 56th minute before midfielder Pascal Jongsma scored a consolation goal for Volendam five minutes from time 
10521 Feyenoord Rotterdam suffered an early shock when they went 1-0 down after four minutes against de Graafschap Doetinchem 
10522 The equaliser came in the 73rd minute when Swedish international Henke Larsson scored from close range and 10 minutes later Jean-Paul van Gastel gave Feyenoord a 2-1 victory from the penalty spot 
10523 After three matches PSV lead the first division with nine points three points clear of fifth-placed Ajax 
10524 SOCCER ROBSON WINS FIRST TROPHY WITH BARCELONA 
10525 MADRID 1996-08-28 
10526 Former England manager Bobby Robson enjoyed his first success in charge of Barcelona as his team weathered 90 minutes of non-stop Atletico Madrid pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup 6-5 on aggregate on Wednesday 
10527 Barcelona had won the first leg 5-2 but the second leg was a different story 
10528 Atletico came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 3-1 ahead 15 minutes from the end 
10529 Juan Lopez gave Atletico the lead midway through the first half after Barcelona fullback Albert Ferrer and substitute goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui failed to clear a Milinko Pantic cross 
10530 Barcelona 's Hristo Stoichkov made his only significant contribution of the evening 10 minutes after halftime when Sergi Barjuan broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser 
10531 But Atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing Juan Eduardo Esnaider and then Serbian set-piece specialist Pantic made it 3-1 with a superb free-kick in the 75th minute 
10532 Robson praised Atletico after the game which was played in the Community of Madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the Vicente Calderon ground 
10533 The venue of Atletico 's first league game scheduled for Sunday is still in doubt with the Real Madrid 's Santiago Bernabeu a distinct possibility

10548 Argentine striker Iwan Cesar Gabrich signed a five year contract with Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam on Wednesday 
10549 The 24-year-old Gabrich who signed for an undisclosed fee from the Argentine side Newell Old Boys is set to join Dutch international Patrick Kluivert in the Ajax forward line 
10550 He is Ajax 's sixth new signing this year joining midfielder Richard Witschge defenders John Veldman and Mariano Juan and strikers Tijjani Babangida and Dani 
10551 SOCCER PARMA ROMA AND UDINESE OUT OF ITALIAN CUP 
10552 ROME 1996-08-28 
10553 UEFA Cup hopefuls Parma and Roma under new coaches this season crashed out of the Italian Cup to second division opponents on Wednesday while league champions Milan could only draw 1-1 at humble Empoli 
10554 Wealthy Parma now coached by the former Italian international Carlo Ancelotti were without new striker Enrico Chiesa and went down 3-1 at serie B club Pescara in their second round clash 
10555 Pescara 's Ottavio Palladini shattered Parma with goals in the second and fourth minutes 
10556 Midfielder Marco Giampaolo made it 3-0 in the 38th minute and Parma 's Alessandro Melli pulled back a late goal six minutes from time 
10557 The second round was the entry point for the bulk of the serie A sides with the winners going through 
10558 The later stages of the cup are played over two legs 
10559 Parma 's defeat was a repeat of last season 's fiasco when they lost their opening cup match 3-0 to Palermo 
10560 Roma now coached by Argentine Carlos Bianchi and watched by Italian national coach Arrigo Sacchi lost 3-1 to Cesena another repeat of last season when the Rome club also went out at the first hurdle 
10561 Udinese with Germany 's Euro 96 hero Oliver Bierhoff in their lineup completed the hat-trick of beaten serie A sides when they went under 2-1 to newly relegated Cremonese 
10562 Milan 's new Uruguayan coach Oscar Tabarez avoided the nightmare of defeat but faces a replay at home next Sunday 
10563 Cup holders Fiorentina easily beat Cosenza 3-1 while European Cup holders Juventus also cruised through with a 2-0 win at small southern club Fidelis Andria 
10564 Two other serie A sides lost at the weekend Piacenza and last year 's losing finalists Atalanta 
10565 Two cup matches could not be played on Wednesday due to argument over first round results 
10566 Lecce 's 3-0 weekend defeat of Genoa was expected to be overturned by a sporting judge on Thursday after the home club fielded an ineligible player 
10567 That would set Genoa up for a second round match against local rivals Sampdoria 
10568 Nocerina 's 4-3 defeat of Piacenza was also subject to a complaint later removed that forced their second round match against serie A newcomers Perugia to be delayed 
10569 SOCCER BAYERN HIT FOUR TO TAKE BUNDESLIGA TOP SPOT 
10570 BONN 1996-08-28 
10571 Goals from Thomas Helmer and Juergen Klinsmann helped Bayern Munich to a 4-2 home win over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday and powered them to the top of the Bundesliga 
10572 The comfortable victory gave Bayern 10 points from their first four games a point ahead of second-placed Stuttgart who have a game in hand 
10573 Brazilian midfielder Paulo Sergio put Leverkusen ahead in the 25th minute but Alexander Zickler equalised just a minute later 
10574 A header from Helmer and an acrobatic strike from Klinsmann gave Bayern a two-goal cushion at halftime 
10575 But the pick of the 13-times champions goals came from Ruggiero Rizzitelli who beat three defenders to put Bayern 4-1 up 
10576 Markus Feldhoff hit a consolation goal for Leverkusen 
10577 Hansa Rostock brought Cologne 's 100 percent record to an end with a 2-0 win over the Rhineside club while a Sean Dundee hat-trick inside seven minutes stood out in Karlsruhe 's 4-0 demolition of St Pauli

10627 SOCCER SMICER 'S LAST-GASP GOAL KEEPS LENS IN THE LEAD 
10628 PARIS 1996-08-28 
10629 Euro 96 star Vladimir Smicer of the Czech Republic scored at the last second for Lens allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday 
10630 Smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 3-2 victory over Montpellier who were leading 2-1 until Cameroon 's Marc-Vivien Foe equalised on a header in the 85th minute 
10631 The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for Lens who lead the table on 12 points 
10632 In-form Paris St Germain who dismissed Nantes 1-0 are second with 10 points 
10633 Along with Smicer Robert Pires was the star of the night in France scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in Metz 's 3-1 home victory over neighbouring Strasbourg 
10634 Pires one of the most promising strikers in the country was called up for the first time this week by French manager Aime Jacquet for a friendly against Mexico on Saturday at the Parc des Princes 
10635 Pires scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break 
10636 A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th 
10637 Smicer 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory 
10638 Spurred by Foe 's leveller five minutes before Lens pressed hard and Foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header 
10639 The ball bounced back to Smicer 's feet and he scored 
10640 Montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to Kader Ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from Lens goalkeeper Jean-Claude Nadon 
10641 The side from northern France forced to fight an uphill battle from then on pulled level thanks to Tony Vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker Fabien Lefevre made it two for Montpellier five minutes later 
10642 League favourites PSG scored a convincing 1-0 win over Nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season 
10643 Ironically PSG 's victory owed a lot to two former Nantes players striker Patrice Loko who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute and defender Benoit Cauet who started the one-two which allowed Loko to score 
10644 The Parisians who have yet to concede a goal were without Brazil 's Leonardo and Panama 's Julio Cesar Dely Valdes both called up by their national sides 
10645 For Nantes who shocked PSG to win the league crown two years ago the fall is very painful 
10646 The Canaries who lost most of their key players within two years have yet to win a match this season 
10647 Reigning champions Auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against Marseille on Tuesday

10784 ATHLETICS CHRISTIE AND JOHNSON ASKED TO JOIN OWENS TRIBUTE 
10785 Adrian Warner 
10786 BONN 1996-08-28 
10787 Organisers hope to persuade Britain 's former Olympic 100 metres champion Linford Christie to join a Dream Team sprint relay in a special tribute to Jesse Owens at Friday 's Berlin grand prix 
10788 Christie who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season was not due to compete in the German capital but Berlin promoter Rudi Thiel said We are still hopeful of getting him to come 
10789 Thiel has managed to get most of the Olympic 100 metres champions since 1948 to attend the meeting which is being held in the stadium where Owens won four gold medals 60 years ago at the Berlin Olympics 
10790 Canada 's Donovan Bailey the Olympic 100 metres champion and world record holder and Namibian Frankie Fredericks the silver medallist at the recent Atlanta Games have already agreed to run in the 4X100 metres team 
10791 Thiel said on Wednesday that he had also asked Olympic 200 and 400 champion Michael Johnson to run as well as Christie 
10792 Most of the Olympic champions of the past are coming including Britain 's 1980 champion Allan Wells 
10793 Christie belongs to them 
10794 It would be great to have him here 
10795 There is a good offer .... 
10796 My minimum would be that he just ran the relay he said 
10797 The 36-year-old Briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday 
10798 Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter 's relatives is expected to attend 
10799 The relay race which will include squads from Africa the United States and Europe as well as the Owens quartet will be held at the end of the meeting 
10800 Organisers had hoped to include 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in Brussels last Friday 
10801 CRICKET NEW CAPTAIN TENDULKAR UPSTAGED BY 120 FROM JAYASURIYA 
10802 COLOMBO 1996-08-28 
10803 Sachin Tendulkar marked his debut as Indian captain with a patient 110 on Wednesday but was upstaged by dashing Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya whose 120 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket Singer Cup win 
10804 Sri Lanka playing in front of their home crowd for the first time since winning the World Cup last March comfortably passed India 's modest 226-5 from 50 overs in 44.2 overs 
10805 The devastating opening pair of Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana shared a fine first wicket stand of 129 to the delight of the 25,000 fans 
10806 Jayasuriya whose first 50 included three sixes and three fours went on to an unbeaten 120 and the man-of-the-match award 
10807 Kaluwitharana slow in comparison was bowled by Tendulkar for 53 but Aravinda de Silva with 49 not out helped see Sri Lanka home 
10808 Earlier Tendulkar completed his ninth century in one-day cricket taking 138 balls to do it before being run out 
10809 The rest of the Indian batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling although ex-captain Mohamed Azharuddin chipped in with 58 adding 129 with Tendulkar off 28 overs before being stumped 
10810 The next match in the four-nation tournament is on Friday when Sri Lanka play Australia in a repeat of the World Cup final in Lahore where Sri Lanka won by seven wickets

10856 PRESS DIGEST ANGOLA AUG 28 
10857 LUANDA 1996-08-28 
10858 These are the leading stories in the Angolan press on Wednesday 
10859 Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy 
10860 JORNAL DE ANGOLA 
10861 Princeton Lyman the U.S. Under-Secretary of State for International Organisations will on Wednesday continue his work in Angola visiting Bailundo where he should be received by Jonas Savimbi leader of Unita 
10862 On Tuesday Lyman participated in a meeting of a joint-commission where he considered that the Angolan politicians should advance faster and find a way to cooperate 
10863 In his opinion the quartering of Unita forces must be concluded in all the Angolan territory and the troops must be selected and integrated in the armed forces the government forces must be concentrated in the principal units and the free circulation of people and goods must be reality in all the country 
10864 S.AFRICAN TRUTH BODY TO SUMMON APARTHEID POLICE 
10865 CAPE TOWN 1996-08-28 
10866 South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it 
10867 We can subpoena anyone we want to even the president of the country spokesman John Allen told Reuters 
10868 Subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week 
10869 Media reports have speculated that the commission which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past could subpoena apartheid-era President P.W. Botha and former police generals Basie Smit and Johan Van Der Merwe 
10870 In submissions last week to the commission National Party leader and former president F.W. De Klerk said he had received no co-operation from Botha in compiling his party 's report 
10871 Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses by both the white minority regime and its opponents 
10872 It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness 
10873 Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear 
10874 Allen declined to give say who would be subpoenaed 
10875 At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than 10 people but this is just the beginning he said 
10876 The commission was set up last year to probe 30 years of human-rights violations during the apartheid era 
10877 It is chaired by Nobel Peace winner retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
10878 Allen said the commission could announce the names of subpoenaed persons on Monday next week 
10879 TURKISH AIRPLANE LANDS IN SOFIA ON BOMB THREAT 
10880 SOFIA 1996-08-28 
10881 A Turkish airliner on flight from Istanbul to Vienna on Wednesday landed in emergency at Sofia airport after receiving a bomb threat said an airport official 
10882 The plane landed at Sofia airport at 1503 1203 GMT after receiving a signal that there is an explosive on board the official who declined to be named told Reuters 
10883 The plane surrounded by 11 fire-engines is being checked for explosives at the moment 
10884 Nothing has been found so far added the official 
10885 In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner hijacked while on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul landed in Sofia airport to refuel before landing in Munich where the hijacker was arrested 
10886 Arch Alberta well tests 1,100 bbl day 
10887 FORT WORTH Texas 1996-08-28 
10888 Arch Petroleum Inc said Wednesday an exploratory well in Alberta 's Morinville area tested in excess of 1,100 barrels daily and will begin production immediately 
10889 The company said the 90 percent owned Trax et al Morinville 10-23 logged 28 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 5,350 feet 
10890 Reserve estimates from this well are at 250,000 gross barrels of oil 
10891 The Trax well is one of the prospects developed by Arch through its early 1996 purchase of Trax Petroleums Ltd the company said 
10892 It said another the Cometra et al Morinville 11-13 has logged 128 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 5,400 feet and is flowing water free at the rate of 590 barrels of oil per day on a 15 64ths-inch choke 
10893 Arch owns a 16 percent working interest in this well with most of the rest held by the privately owned operator 
10894 Arch said full production has begun and initial estimates of gross reserves attributable to this well range up to one million barrels of oil 
10895 A third well drilled in this area the Trax et al Morinville 2-25 encountered the Leduc Reef but tested wet 
10896 At the company 's Nordegg prospect the Apache et al Saunders 14-28 has reached total depth in the Leduc Reef at approximately 3,800 feet and has been abandoned Arch said 
10897 It said this acreage earning well brought an interest in an additional 5,120 acres building the company 's gross land position in this area to 8,320 acres 
10898 At the Butte prospect the Garrington 4-8 has reached total depth of 11,500 and has logged 278 feet of Leduc Reef 
10899 Testing has begun and results will be announced within the next several days Arch said 
10900 Including the costs of the two abandoned wells the company said these first prospects have added to reserves at a finding cost of about U.S. $ 2 per barrel of oil equivalent

10902 U.S. judge orders Biogen Berlex officials deposed 
10903 Leslie Gevirtz 
10904 BOSTON 1996-08-28 
10905 In order to help him decide whether he should hear the case a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday ordered the legal counsels of Biogen Inc and Berlex Laboratories a subsidiary of Schering AG deposed 
10906 The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration violated the Orphan Drug law by allowing Biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex 
10907 Berlex also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug Betaseron that it is a patent infringement 
10908 Both drugs are types of interferon 
10909 One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share 
10910 BioVest Research Inc 's analyst Eddie Hedaya said Berlex sales are losing share like mad 
10911 my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations 
10912 He added Chiron Corp reported its sales of inventory to Berlex was down 
10913 Chiron makes Betaseron ; Berlex markets it he said 
10914 Biogen in its Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly report for the period ending June 30 said it had earned $ 6.1 million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market 
10915 When it approved Avonex in May the FDA said both Biogen 's product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the Ophran Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases 
10916 Avonex has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon beta-1b Betaseron .. 
10917 the FDA said 
10918 Now U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf has ordered the chief counsel for Biogen Michael Astrue and Robert Chabora his counterpart at Berlex be deposed about a May 21 meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by Biogen against Berlex should be heard in Massachusetts 
10919 Berlex filed a lawsuit against Biogen in U.S. District Court in Newark N.J. in July but Biogen had already filed a suit against Berlex in Massachusetts in May 
10920 Wolf ordered the depositions to determine if he or U.S. District Judge John Bissell of Newark should preside over the case

10933 NEW YORK 1996-08-28 
10934 COMEX copper ended higher after a late modest recovery dragged the market from the lows but traders shrugged-off an imminent strike at Codelco 's Salvador mine in Chile 
10935 The market was also waiting for Friday 's LME stock report which will include figures delayed from Tuesday because of the U.K. public holiday on Monday when the LME was closed 
10936 We are in the late stages of the weaker period of the market and as we get to the post Labor Day market we will start to see more consumer interest and the demand side of the market will start to firm prices up said William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch 
10937 December COMEX settled 0.35 cent higher at 90.20 cents traded 90.50 to 89.40 cents 
10938 September went out 0.05 cent lower at 91.05 
10939 The August contract expired at 0.85 cent down at 90.85 cents 
10940 Volume was estimated at 8,000 lots 
10941 Workers at Salvador voted to strike from Saturday and it was not clear when further talks between the unions and management would take place 
10942 Salvador is a small facility and the prospects are that if there will be a strike it will not be a long strike O'Neill said

10945 NEW YORK 1996-08-28 
10946 Average daily shipments from U.S. copper service centers in July fell three percent from the previous month but were higher than in July 1995 the Copper and Brass Servicenter Association reported 
10947 July was still above the historic average for that month the CBSA said 
10948 In the first seven months of 1996 shipments of copper sheet coil and strip were 2.2 percent ahead of the same period last year 
10949 Alloy shipments however were 7.5 percent down 
10950 Several service centers indicated that while their volume of orders remains constant the size-per-order continues to be smaller than what was realised during the first five months of the year the CBSA said 
10951 Service centers continued to lower their inventories in July when total copper stocks were off two percent and alloy products down 1.9 percent

10962 NEW YORK 1996-08-28 
10963 Chile 's state oil company Empresa Nacional del Petroleo ENAP bought a second spot cargo of Oriente and nearly one million barrels of Escravos in a recent tender traders said Wednesday 
10964 A 400,000 barrel cargo of Ecuadorian Oriente and 960,000 barrels of Nigerian Escravos was awarded in a tender for Oct 15-18 late last week but price information remains vague 
10965 The Oriente will be supplied by the same seller at a small premium to formula a trade source said referring to the first October cargo sold two weeks ago at Petroecuador 's sale formula plus five cents fob 
10966 Escravos was sold on a Dated Brent related basis with premiums for the light grade seen in the low 50-cent range 
10967 The next purchase tender from ENAP is expected for late October or early November crude traders said

11126 Dutroux suspected in murder of Slovak woman 
11127 Peter Laca 
11128 BRATISLAVA 1996-08-28 
11129 Marc Dutroux the chief accused in a Belgian child murder and sex abuse scandal is suspected of murdering a young Slovak woman the Slovak office of Interpol said on Wednesday 
11130 Rudolf Gajdos head of Slovak Interpol told a news conference Dutroux was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman 
11131 One of the police versions in the case of the murder of young gypsy woman in Topolcany western Slovakia this July is a suspicion that Mark Dutroux could have been involved in the murder Gajdos said without elaborating on the age of the victim and on the other versions 
11132 Slovak police Interpol and Belgian police have been following leads on Dutroux 's activities in Slovakia and the neighbouring Czech Republic where he is known to have made frequent visits 
11133 Gajdos said the police sketch of the suspected murderer was 60 percent identical with Dutroux 's portrait and that Dutroux was known to have been in Topolcany around the time of the woman 's murder 
11134 Topolcany and the area around this town were reported to have been the most visited places by Dutroux and his accomplices in Slovakia Gajdos said 
11135 Dutroux a convicted child rapist and unemployed father-of-three led police 11 days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of the six houses he owns around the southern Belgian city of Charleroi 
11136 The Belgian police also informed us that Dutroux together with one other man had also planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman Gajdos said 
11137 The plan apparently failed due to difficulties in crossing the border he added but did not elaborate 
11138 The Slovak police are also investigating visits by about 10 Slovak women aged 17 to 22 to Belgium at the invitation of Dutroux 
11139 The women said they went to Belgium voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films Gajdos said earlier this week 
11140 But he added they had difficulty remembering what happened during their visits to Belgium perhaps because of drugs and were unsure whether they were filmed for pornography 
11141 Dutroux 39 who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two girls aged 14 and 12 is also suspected in the disappearance of Belgians An Marchal 19 and Eefje Lambrecks 17 who went missing a year ago

11151 Russian shares slip in thin volume 
11152 MOSCOW 1996-08-28 
11153 Leading Russian shares edged down on Wednesday in thin volume in the absence of Western orders traders said 
11154 The Russian Trading System index of 21 issues fell 1.64 percent to 180.38 on volume of $ 4.38 million 
11155 The market was extremely quiet today some profit-taking locally no Western orders said Nick Mokhoff director of sales and trade at Alliance-Menatep 
11156 We are just a bit lower with a lot of inactivity during the whole day 
11157 Alexander Babayan managing director at CentrInvest Securities said the volume of orders was four to five times lower than a week ago 
11158 As often the most volume was in UES 
11159 Unified is one of the blue chips which has more prospects than anybody else does because they have ADRs supposedly coming up Mokhoff said 
11160 UES officials said last week the board had not yet approved the final version of its application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue ADRs 
11161 UES fell to $ 0.0817 from $ 0.0822 at Tuesday 's close with 8.90 million shares changing hands 
11162 Gazprom was the loser of the day with prices closing at $ 0.300 down from $ 0.355 on Tuesday and $ 0.445 on Monday 
11163 Mokhoff said uncertainty about when Gazprom would issue ADRs and about whether shares from the Russian market could be converted into ADRs had hurt prices 
11164 Western investors will be investing in ADRs and I do not think people in Russia will be able to come up with the money for the underlying shares to drive the Russian shares to those levels Mokhoff said 
11165 Gazprom has also tightened the rules restricting shareholers rights to trade its shares 
11166 Mosenergo closed at at $ 0.958 after $ 0.966 Rostelekom fell to $ 2.56 from $ 2.58 and LUKoil was $ 9.82 after $ 9.85

11185 Yeltsin had told Kohl about efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in Russia 's breakaway Chechnya region Interfax added

11188 Exiled Bosnians protest confusing voting rules 
11189 Duncan Shiels 
11190 NAGYATAD Hungary 1996-08-28 
11191 Bosnian refugees in Hungary the first to vote last weekend in their country 's first post-war election found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for refugees and officials said on Wednesday 
11192 For the most part they really did n't understand what was going on the director of the Nagyatad camp Lajos Horvath told Reuters on Wednesday 
11193 It was confusing they had no experience of voting many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates he said 
11194 They just voted along ethnic lines where they could 
11195 The Bosnian election is set for September 14 and voting began on Wednesday for most of the 600,000 Bosnians living abroad 
11196 The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which is running the election allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four Hungarian refugee camps 
11197 Some Moslem refugees among the 385 registered voters Hungary 's largest camp Nagyatad have written to the OSCE complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the Bosnian-Croat Federation where most Moslems live 
11198 This was because their pre-war homes are now in the Serb-controlled territory so they were voting for the national assembly of the Republika Srbska most of the candidates for which are Serbs 
11199 For the foreign powers which back last year 's Dayton peace agreement the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state 
11200 But Adem Hodzic one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint told Reuters 
11201 We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other Bosnian Moslems to choose our president 
11202 This vote seals the division of my country 
11203 Under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and House of Representatives for all Bosnia-Hercegovina and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the Moslem-Croat Federation or the Republika Srbska 
11204 On Sunday voters in Hungary also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the OSCE on Tuesday 
11205 Husein Micijevic who also signed the letter alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by Hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them 
11206 Probably 100 refugees were shown where to put their cross he said 
11207 Seventy eight-year-old Mandolina Zelic a Bosnian Croat who has spent the last five years in Nagyatad told Reuters she had cast her ballot because she 'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for 
11208 At first the organisers would n't let anyone help me but when they saw I did n't understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark she said 
11209 I do n't know who I voted for 
11210 Maria Szabo of the Hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the OSCE told Reuters on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed OSCE instructions very carefully 
11211 The envelopes each with the five different voting slips were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote she said 
11212 But of course those who could not read had to be shown 
11213 Estonia presidential race next round on Sept 20 
11214 TALLINN 1996-08-28 
11215 Estonia will hold the next round of an inconclusive state presidential race on September 20 parliamentary officers of the Baltic state ruled on Wednesday 
11216 This comes after three votes in the 101-strong parliament on Monday and Tuesday failed to give either incumbent Lennart Meri or rival candidate Arnold Ruutel the necessary 68 votes for a clear mandate 
11217 The outcome was a rebuff for Meri failing three times to win backing in his bid for a second term as head of state of the former Soviet republic 
11218 Parliament 's press officer told Reuters that Speaker Toomas Savi will convene an electoral college involving 101 MPs and and 273 local government representatives on September 20 
11219 Both Meri 67 and Ruutel 68 will automatically be listed as candidates but the election will also be open to new nominations with the backing of any 21 members of the college 
11220 The winner has to secure a majority from the college within two rounds of voting otherwise the election will go back before the parliament 
11221 Lebed likely to fail on Chechnya Polish minister 
11222 WARSAW 1996-08-28 
11223 Russian security chief Aleksander Lebed faces an almost impossible task in Chechnya and is likely to be sidelined Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati was reported as saying on Wednesday 
11224 According to best-selling daily Gazeta Wyborcza Rosati told the Polish parliament 's foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact Lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in Chechnya showed he would be marginalised 
11225 It is almost impossible to gain success in this it quoted Rosati as saying during a committee debate 
11226 Lebed has no diplomatic experience 
11227 Yeltsin sent him there to compromise him 
11228 This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action he said 
11229 Lebed who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern Russia region was in Moscow this week seeking support for a deal on Chechnya 's political status 
11230 But Russian President Boris Yeltsin has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday 
11231 Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Rosati as saying Yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave but for now retained control in Russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators 
11232 Rosati said Russia 's July polls in which Yeltsin won re-election showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had chosed the path of further reforms 
11233 But he said a power struggle in Russia 's ruling circles could not be ruled out which could harm further reforms 
11234 He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy saying this could lead to social unrest the daily reported 
11235 On Moscow 's foreign policy Rosati said it had changed its stance on NATO 's eastward expansion and was preparing itself for Poland 's inevitable entry into the Western alliance 
11236 He also reportedly criticised Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov saying his style of work resembled that of the Soviet-era 1970s and 1980s 
11237 Romania state budget soars in June 
11238 BUCHAREST 1996-08-28 
11239 Romania 's state budget deficit jumped sharply in June to 1,242.9 billion lei for the January-June period from 596.5 billion lei in January-May official data showed on Wednesday 
11240 Six-month expenditures stood at 9.50 trillion lei up from 7.56 trillion lei at end-May with education and health spending accounting for 31.6 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 26 percent 
11241 January-June revenues went up to 8.26 trillion lei from 6.96 trillion lei in the first five months this year 
11242 Romania 's government is expected to revise the 1996 budget on Wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation new wage and pension indexations and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit 
11243 Under the revised version state spending is expected to rise by some 566 billion lei

11250 Costa Rica says Dutch pair kidnapped by Nicaraguans 
11251 SAN JOSE Costa Rica 1996-08-28 
11252 The Costa Rican government said on Wednesday that a Dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern Costa Rica was kidnapped by former Nicaraguan guerrillas 
11253 Even though it 's an act of common delinquency the case could take a difficult turn because former Nicaraguan guerrillas are involved Security Minister Bernardo Arce told reporters 
11254 Earlier this year a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border 
11255 They were held for 71 days before relatives paid a ransom to free them 
11256 Two Nicaraguan former guerrillas have been arrested in the case 
11257 Because of the apparent threat to foreigners in Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border Arce said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own 
11258 Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife Jetsi Hendrika Coers both 50 years old were seized late on Saturday or early on Sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car leaving behind a ransom note demanding $ 1.5 million 
11259 The plantation is owned by Dutch citizen Ebe Huizinga who has since arrived in Costa Rica to deal with the matter 
11260 Gov't dodging extradition Colombian official says 
11261 BOGOTA Colombia 1996-08-28 
11262 A top judicial official and critic of President Ernesto Samper accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift Colombia 's five-year-old ban on extradition 
11263 It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government Deputy Prosecutor-General Adolfo Salamanca said 
11264 Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators one of them a member of Samper 's own Liberal Party aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in 1991 
11265 U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette applauded the move saying it could prompt the Clinton administration to remove Colombia from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in U.S. counternarcotics efforts 
11266 Samper who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money appeared less than enthusiastic however 
11267 Extradition is not on the government 's legislative agenda he told reporters on Tuesday 
11268 He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue 
11269 But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting Colombian drug lords onto U.S.-bound flights to serve stiff penalities in American prisons 
11270 Salamanca who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in Colombia has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that Samper 's campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country 's top drug lords 
11271 Quake shakes Costa Rica during Hashimoto visit 
11272 SAN JOSE Costa Rica 1996-08-28 
11273 A moderate earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale shook Costa Rica on Wednesday during a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto but there were no reports of casualties or damage officials said

11275 The quake was felt for about seven seconds in most of the country but preliminary reports said no one was hurt it added 
11276 The quake took place a few minutes before the end of a welcoming ceremony at Juan Santamaria airport for Hashimoto who was starting a three-hour visit as part of a Latin American tour 
11277 Hashimoto who arrived at 11 a.m. 1700 GMT showed no sign of having felt the quake witnesses said 
11278 Barrier removed to Brazil CVRD sell-off 
11279 BRASILIA 1996-08-28 
11280 The Brazilian Senate Wednesday agreed to shelve a bill linking the privatization of mining conglomerate Vale do Rio Doce to congressional approval officials said

11282 The motion was put forward by Sen 
11283 Jose Eduardo Dutra who had drawn up the bill 
11284 The Senate vote also annulled a substitute version of Dutra 's bill which had sought to dedicate revenue from Vale 's privatization to regional infrastructure projects

11311 PLO Council calls for halt to contacts with Israel 
11312 RAMALLAH West Bank 1996-08-28 
11313 The Palestinian Legislative Council on Wednesday called for a halt to contacts with Israel just hours after President Yasser Arafat said the Jewish state had effectively declared war on the Palestinians by pursuing its hardline policies 
11314 A resolution released by the council called for halting contacts with the Israeli side and leaving the mechanism to carry out this to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat 
11315 The council was meeting in Ramallah to discuss Israel 's new policy of Jewish settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on Jerusalem since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June 
11316 Council resolutions are not necessarily binding 
11317 Arafat had earlier blasted Israel saying its policies amounted to a declaration of war against the Palestinian people 
11318 He also called for the first general strike in two years in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday 
11319 What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people Arafat told the council 
11320 Council speaker Ahmed Korei said the decision was part of a comprehensive plan to confront Israeli settlement policy land confiscation and what he termed other violations of the Israeli-PLO peace deals 
11321 Iraqi Kurd group says agrees new ceasefire 
11322 ANKARA 1996-08-28 
11323 An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said it had agreed a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire with a rival faction after a previous accord was shattered by sporadic fighting between the groups in recent days 
11324 The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan PUK leadership declares its endorsement for a ceasefire arrangement with the KDP Kurdistan Democratic Party to take effect as of 8:00 a.m. on August 28 the PUK said in a statement 
11325 The PUK said the ceasefire was agreed after talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau and PUK leader Jalal Talabani 
11326 The KDP led by Massoud Barzani had said a previous ceasefire negotiated by Pelletreau last Friday was broken by the PUK 
11327 Talabani has agreed to take part in talks in London on reaching a comprehensive settlement for the PUK-KDP conflict the PUK statement said 
11328 It said the KDP was responsible for breaking the previous ceasefire by refusing to endorse it publicly 
11329 Kurd group says Iraqi troops massing near north 
11330 ANKARA 1996-08-28 
11331 An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said Iraq was massing troops near Kurdish regions in the north where a U.S.-led allied air force protects the local population against attacks from Baghdad 
11332 The Iraqi regime has started threatening the Kurdish population by massing troops in preparation to attack Kurdish towns and population centres the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan PUK said in a statement 
11333 The PUK said it had received confirmed reports that Iraqi troops supported by tanks artillery and armoured vehicles have already penetrated some Kurdish areas 
11334 It said the military presence reflects cooperation between President Saddam Hussein and the PUK 's rival the Kurdistan Democratic Party KDP 
11335 The PUK statement follows KDP assertions that the PUK is receiving military support from Iran 
11336 Hostilities between the two warring Iraqi Kurdish factions have continued in the last few days despite a U.S.-brokered ceasefire last Friday 
11337 The PUK called on the United Nations and allied forces to halt the Iraqi aggression 
11338 U.S. French and British aircraft have safeguarded the Iraqi Kurdish population against aggression from Baghdad since shortly after the Gulf War in 1991 
11339 The allied force known as Operation Provide Comfort is based in southern Turkey 
11340 Iraq says hijackers were not diplomats 
11341 BAGHDAD 1996-08-28 
11342 Iraq on Wednesday said the hijackers of a Sudanese airliner were not Iraqi diplomats and added that noble Iraqis would never contemplate such an action 
11343 The official Iraqi News Agency INA quoted Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum as saying that Iraq 's embassy in the Sudanese capital had nothing to do with the Monday night hijacking 
11344 Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum denounced the hijacking and described it as a terrorist act which had nothing to do with the morals and values of noble Iraqis INA said 
11345 Ambassador Abdulsamad Hameed Ali told INA there was only one diplomat among the 199 passengers and crew on the Sudan Airways Airbus 
11346 He was not involved 
11347 on the contrary he was harassed by the elements which carried out the hijacking he said 
11348 INA did not say the hijackers were Iraqis 
11349 The hijack started when the flight left Khartoum for Amman on Monday night 
11350 The hijackers told the crew they had grenades and other explosives and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not taken to London 
11351 The airliner refuelled at Larnaca Cyprus and landed at London 's Stansted airport in the early hours of Tuesday 
11352 Seven Iraqi suspected hijackers surrendered and British police said they had apparently asked for political asylum 
11353 Several had brought their families along including children 
11354 Dole blasts Clinton for ignoring teen drug use 
11355 Judith Crosson 
11356 VENTURA Calif. 1996-08-28 
11357 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the National Guard to stop drugs from entering the United States 
11358 He 'll probably mention his war on drugs which he 's going to start like everything else next year 
11359 It 's too late Mr. President Dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school 
11360 He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales 
11361 Welcome to the club 
11362 We 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks Dole said 
11363 Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her just say no anti-drug message 
11364 But it worked Dole said 
11365 Meanwhile in Los Angeles Dole 's running mate Jack Kemp campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 Los Angeles riots 
11366 Kemp told a crowd of about 300 African Americans in south central Los Angeles Keep your eyes open keep your ears open keep your heart open 
11367 I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote 
11368 In Dole 's address to a group that was largely white the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use 
11369 They 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people whether it 's a needle whether it 's a cigarette whatever the delivery system is it 's poison and it 's got to stop in America 
11370 he said 
11371 Dole said 70 percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and 40 percent of the marijuana came from Mexico 
11372 We 've got an international problem and I 'm prepared to use our military might 
11373 We want to stop drugs at the border he said 
11374 Dole 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes 
11375 I did n't say anything about cigarettes 
11376 I was talking about drugs 
11377 I said you should n't smoke either 
11378 That 's all I said he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers 
11379 When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes Dole replied Oh no 
11380 Come on you know better than that 
11381 Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke 
11382 Dole also said he opposed California Proposition 215 which if approved by voters would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses 
11383 Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail 
11384 In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms Dole said three times during his 20-minute address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people 
11385 The anti-drug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal 
11386 On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of raising the white flag in the war on drugs 
11387 A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past four years 
11388 Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov 
11389 Pete Wilson who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone 
11390 We need all the help we can get 
11391 We need to get the kind of help we used to get when Ronald Reagan and George Bush were in the White House Wilson said

11431 WHEAT--Rains boost U.S. HRW planting prospects 
11432 Greg Frost 
11433 KANSAS CITY Mo 
11434 1996-08-28 
11435 Above-normal summer rainfall in the U.S. High Plains has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop analysts said Wednesday 
11436 From central Texas north to Kansas rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year 
11437 Our moisture situation is excellent especially for fall planting of winter wheat said Kim Anderson extension wheat marketing economist at Oklahoma State University 
11438 The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s 
11439 It 's definitely a turnabout from this past year but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year and then about October 1 it quit said Mark Hodges executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission 
11440 Hopefully that 's not going to happen this year 
11441 According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between March 1 and August 26 1996 
11442 That 's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period according to Howard Johnson associate state climatologist at the University of Oklahoma 
11443 He noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since July 
11444 As an example of just how dry it was data showed that between October 1 1995 and March 1 1996 the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall 
11445 In northern Texas the current rainfall situation was similar to most of Oklahoma said Rodney Mosier executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers 
11446 Up here in the Texas Panhandle we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat Mosier said 
11447 But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern Texas where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week 
11448 In Kansas typically the number one U.S. hard red winter wheat producer topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday according to the state 's agricultural statistics service 
11449 In its weekly report released Monday the service said Kansas topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus 77 percent adequate and 15 percent short to very short 
11450 Oklahoma 's Agricultural Statistics Service showed similar conditions rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus 81 percent adequate and 12 percent short to very short 
11451 Data on topsoil moisture ratings were not released by the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service

11453 First Union National Bank of Fla. settles suit 
11454 JACKSONVILLE Fla. 1996-08-28 
11455 First Union National Bank of Florida said on Wednesday it agreed to settle a class action law suit involving its collateral protection insurance CPI program 
11456 To provide for the settlements First Union has established a common fund of $ 4.7 million for cash refunds and $ 19.4 million in credit refunds for outstanding CPI balances 
11457 The bank is a division of First Union Corp 
11458 The bank said most of the charges resulted from loan portfolios from banks and thrifts that were acquired in the 1980s 
11459 First Union said it has discontinued CPI as an element of its motor vehicle or boat installment loan contracts 
11460 As part of the settlement agreement customers who had CPI placed on loans from January 1 1986 to September 31 1996 will receive cash or credit refunds the bank said 
11461 Cash refunds will go to those who paid their loans to First Union while credit refunds will go to those who have existing loan balances the bank said 
11462 Amoco says in talks over Yemen oil acreage 
11463 NEW YORK 1996-08-28 
11464 Amoco Corp officials said the company is in talks over crude oil production sharing in Yemen but declined to comment on a published report Amoco had reached preliminary agreement on a block in the Shabwa area 
11465 We 've been asked by Yemen not to comment on the talks said Amoco spokesman Dan Dietsch 
11466 We can neither confirm nor deny that report he said 
11467 According to Middle East Economic Survey MEES Yemen and Amoco signed a memorandum of understanding for a production-sharing agreement in Shabwa Block No 
11468 S-1 in the former South Yemen which united with North Yemen in 1990 
11469 According to another Amoco official the company is not exploring now for oil anywhere in Yemen 
11470 The officials said Amoco was deferring to the Yemeni Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals for any specific comments on the Amoco-Yemen talks 
11471 The former Soviet Union was displaced as contractor of the potentially rich Shabwa oilfields once it collapsed in December 1991 according to the International Petroleum Encyclopedia

11473 Burundi defends military regime to hostile UN 
11474 Evelyn Leopold 
11475 UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-28 
11476 Burundi 's ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government 
11477 In a lengthy debate on Burundi before the U.N. Security Council Ambassador Nsanze Terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere 
11478 Nearly every African member who spoke as well as most Security Council members however were unsympathetic towards the government of President Pierre Buyoya an army major put in power in a July coup by the Tutsi-run military which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus 
11479 These African brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of Burundi Terence said of the economic embargo 
11480 Quite the contrary Burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people a gratuitous immolation of the people of Burundi 
11481 He said his government had just asked U.N. human rights monitors to increase their numbers in Burundi in an effort to put an end to this vicious circle of violence 
11482 More than 150,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since 1993 
11483 Botswana 's envoy Mothusi Nkgowe said coups should be relegated to the dump heap of history as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government 
11484 Chile has proposed a resolution still under discussion that would impose an immediate arms embargo on Burundi and call for negotiations 
11485 The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution 
11486 Among the council 's five permanent members Russia and the United States appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal while Britain France and China were cautious 
11487 Terence a Tutsi said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to armed terroritsts 
11488 But Chilean Ambassador Juan Somavia said Every weapon that reached Burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian 
11489 We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves 
11490 Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action 
11491 Burundi 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but Terence told reporters Buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October 
11492 The United States said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued 
11493 Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said the new government should have unconditional negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country 
11494 He said Washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders 
11495 But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring Rwanda where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago 
11496 He again said the United Nations should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention 
11497 Swiss arrest Rwandan on genocide suspicion 
11498 BERNE 1996-08-28 
11499 Swiss authorities said on Wednesday they had arrested a former Rwandan mayor now living in Switzerland on suspicion of violating human rights during the genocide in his country in 1994 
11500 The Defence Ministry said in a statement that investigations were still in the preliminary stage but it was cooperating closely with police in the cantons of Geneva and Freiburg 
11501 It did not identify the man

11537 Anti-Bhutto rally draws about 8,000 in Karachi 
11538 KARACHI Pakistan 1996-08-28 
11539 About 8,000 protesters marched through Karachi on Wednesday demanding the removal of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto witnesses said 
11540 From here we will march to Islamabad and by God we will not let Benazir and Bhutto 's husband Asif Ali Zardari escape justice Nawaz Sharif leader of the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League told a rally organised by a 16-party alliance 
11541 Sharif accused Bhutto of corruption and nepotism charges she has denied in the past 
11542 Witnesses said protesters carrying colourful party flags walked for several miles chanting anti-government slogans 
11543 The event was part of an opposition campaign launched on August 14 Pakistan 's independence day 
11544 Sharif said similar rallies would be held in the Balochistan provincial capital Quetta and the Punjab provincial capital Lahore before an opposition march on the capital Islamabad 
11545 I promise the people of Karachi that those responsible for the extra-judicial killing of innocent youths would not be spared Sharif said 
11546 Karachi 's ethnic Mohajir National Movement MQM accuses the government of killing many of its militants in cold blood 
11547 The government has denied the charge and blames the MQM for much of the violence that killed 2,000 people in the city last year 
11548 Political observers said the turn-out was disappointing for a city of about 12 million people possibly indicating that the MQM although a member of the opposition alliance had not mobilised its supporters for the event 
11549 The turbulent southern port has been calmer this year but police say more than 300 people have died in political unrest 
11550 The MQM speaks for Urdu-speaking Moslems who migrated from India at Partition in 1947 and their descendants 
11551 Sharif a former prime minister is the main political rival of Bhutto who defeated him in the October 1993 election 
11552 He said only the removal of the government and an early election could save Pakistan from disaster 
11553 We will dislodge the Bhutto government 
11554 It is a holy war for us he said 
11555 Bhutto has vowed to complete her five-year term 
11556 India ACC Apr-Jul 96 sales output up 
11557 BOMBAY 1996-08-28 
11558 India 's leading cement firm Associated Cement Companies ACC said on Wednesday its cement sales rose to 3.1 million tonnes in April-July 1996 from 2.93 million a year ago 
11559 ACC Chairman Nani Palkhivala told shareholders at the firm 's annual meeting cement output rose to 3.14 million tonnes in the first quarter of 1996/97 April-March from 3.01 million a year ago 
11560 Palkhivala said ACC had secured government approval to take over a sick cement firm with a grinding capacity of 275,000 tonnes per year 
11561 We will take it over early next month he said 
11562 Talking about the cement industry in general Palkhivala said Indian production rose by about 10 percent in 1995/96 
11563 The industry saw capacity expansion of about 13 percent over 1994/95 from 77.79 million tonnes to 87.45 million tonnes Palkhivala told shareholders 
11564 He said Indian cement exports dropped about eight percent from the previous year because of stiff international competition and inadequate infrastructural facilities 
11565 ACC 's own export performance was marginally better than in 1994/95 on account of a 36 percent rise in exports to Nepal and the opening of a new market Sri Lanka he said 
11566 Despite power shortages ACC achieved a satisfactory growth in production during the year with the help of its power plants 
11567 ACC sold 9.4 million tonnes in 1995/96 retaining its top position in the Indian cement industry Palkhivala said

11578 India fishermen say forced to carry Tamil refugees 
11579 P.V. Krishnamoorthy 
11580 RAMESWARAM India 1996-08-28 
11581 Indian fishermen said on Wednesday they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in Sri Lanka to India as a protest strike by more than 30,000 fishermen entered its ninth day 
11582 There is little we can do when at mid-sea 
11583 The LTTE Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam accosts us and at the point of a gun forces us to take refugees said senior fishermen leader P. Arulanandam 
11584 Some 850 refugees have landed in recent weeks at the port of Rameswaram in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu home to 50 million Tamil-speaking people port officials say 
11585 Rameswaram is 15 km 10 miles off the coast of Sri Lanka 
11586 State chief minister M. Karunanidhi has publicly welcomed the refugees who are fleeing the 13-year war between Tamil separatists and government troops that Colombo says has cost 50,000 lives 
11587 But the influx has triggered fears of a repeat of the 1980s when some 200,000 refugees landed in Tamil Nadu 
11588 Intelligence officals said more than 5,000 Tamils were waiting on the western coast of Sri Lanka to cross into India 
11589 The Indian government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees 
11590 The fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government 's cancellation of three trawlers fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying Tamil refugees 
11591 All Fishermen 's Association secretary N.J. Bose said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met 
11592 Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and Sri Lankan naval custody and gives us assurance it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees we will not call off our strike Bose said 
11593 LTTE spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the Palk Strait 
11594 Indian fishermen come right up to Pesalai to fish and when refugees request them to ferry them across they readily oblige 
11595 Only some take money Sri Lankan boatman Chinnathambi said 
11596 Arulanandam denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to India and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees arrival 
11597 We have not gone to sea since August 19 but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless 
11598 How could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? 
11599 he said 
11600 An Indian Fisheries Department official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between India and Sri Lanka but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of Sri Lanka 's pomfret-rich waters

11616 MILTIADIS EVERT HEADS TO ALEXANDROUPOLIS THIS WEEKEND 
11617 ATHENS 1996-08-28 
11618 Conservative New Democracy ND party leader Miltiadis Evert will be hitting the campaign trail and head to Alexandroupolis this weekend to speak to the city 's businessmen on Sunday morning ND said 
11619 Evert will depart for Alexandroupolis on Saturday afternoon 
11620 Prime Minister Costas Simitis criticized Evert today for unleashing a seven-point economic package that offers tax relief to merchants and other professionals higher pensions to farmers and support for small business 
11621 The finance ministry estimated the cost of ND 's economic measures to over 600 billion drachmas but ND officials put the figure much lower to about 300 billion drachmas 
11622 Simitis blamed ND for the low absorption rate of EU funds and said the socialists will increase farmers pensions combat tax evasion and accelerate GDP growth rates to 4.0 percent in a few years 
11623 Faster economic growth is a major component of ND 's economic programme and Evert has repeatedly blamed the socialists for the slow economic growth

11625 Dow pushes London stocks to new record 
11626 Peter Griffiths 
11627 LONDON 1996-08-28 
11628 A firm start on Wall Street helped push leading London shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the Paris bourse slipped sharply hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest 
11629 On the foreign exchange markets a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade 
11630 London shares boosted by Wall Street added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly 
11631 One focus was British Airways which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of open skies talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines 
11632 The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S 
11633 Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities 
11634 The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling $ 788 million while June 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds 
11635 Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling 
11636 German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar 
11637 The 30-share DAX index closed at 2,563.16 points up 4.32 
11638 However French stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main CAC-40 index 
11639 Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes 
11640 Louis Viannet leader of France 's Communist-led CGT union criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays 
11641 Later in the day helped by the firmer Wall Street opening Paris climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory 
11642 In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the European afternoon up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs 
11643 It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey or tankan of major manufacturers an important gauge of business sentiment 
11644 The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels weakening the yen 
11645 The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent 
11646 The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year 
11647 A BOJ spokesman said the doors to the recovery have not been shut 
11648 the recovery is still continuing 
11649 These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further 
11650 The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely said currency economist Klaus Baader 
11651 Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production showing the economy was still faltering 
11652 CURRENCIES AT 1500 GMT 
11653 The dollar was at 108.40 yen and 1.4765 marks compared with Tuesday 's European close of 107.78 yen and 1.4779 marks 
11654 STOCK MARKETS AT 1500 GMT 
11655 The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had risen 15 points to 3,920.7

11667 Arafat says Israel declares war on Palestinians 
11668 Wafa Amr 
11669 RAMALLAH West Bank 1996-08-28 
11670 Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday that Israel had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years 
11671 What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people Arafat told the Palestinian legislature 
11672 Accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stupidity Arafat launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May 
11673 The tirade was sparked by Israel 's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem 
11674 Israel has started the war on Jerusalem 
11675 They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle Arafat said in Arabic 
11676 There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem 
11677 Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle 
11678 Arafat called for a general strike for Jerusalem on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
11679 There has not been a joint shutdown there since May 1994 when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 1993 
11680 The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade 
11681 Some 25,000 Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs mainly in construction in Israel 
11682 But Palestinians once the backbone of the building industry have been largely replaced by labourers from Romania and China 
11683 On Friday all Moslems including Palestinians in Israel 
11684 will go to Jerusalem 's Al-Aqsa mosque and pray 
11685 Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them Arafat said 
11686 Officials in Netanyahu 's office were not immediately available for comment on Arafat 's remarks 
11687 Israeli travel restrictions imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem 
11688 Netanyahu who opposes trading occupied land for peace made Jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign accusing Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians 
11689 Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital 
11690 The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state 
11691 In his speech to the crowded legislature Arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although alarm bells are ringing 
11692 He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross who held talks in Paris on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials 
11693 When Arafat returned to the podium he said senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas better known as Abu Mazen and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold could meet on Thursday 
11694 He quoted Ross as telling him The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move 
11695 Arafat said he replied is this like their previous promises ? 
11696 No they have good intentions Arafat quoted Ross as saying 
11697 Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government 
11698 The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in Hebron

11712 Prodi will also meet President Suleyman Demirel and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller Akbel said 
11713 Turkey says 25 Kurd rebels killed in clashes 
11714 DIYARBAKIR Turkey 1996-08-28 
11715 Turkish troops killed 25 Kurdish rebels in recent clashes in the east of the country security officials said on Wednesday

11771 US investors mull appeal of Lloyd 's decision 
11772 Patricia Vowinkel 
11773 NEW YORK 1996-08-27 
11774 U.S. investors in troubled Lloyd 's of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a U.S. court decision in favour of Lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions 
11775 A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse 
11776 A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered Lloyd 's to give investors known as Names more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan 
11777 My prediction is that the Names will appeal said Kenneth Chiate a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association 
11778 At this point it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal he said 
11779 But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is 
11780 Under the reorganisation plan Lloyd 's plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called Equitas 
11781 The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities 
11782 The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 GMT Wednesday but Lloyd 's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended 
11783 At least eight U.S. states have still some form of litigation pending said John Head spokesman for the Association of Lloyd 's State Chairmen a group representing U.S. Names 
11784 It goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed Head said of the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sitting in Baltimore 
11785 But he said we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this 
11786 The Colorado attorney general told Lloyd 's last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market based on allegations of consumer fraud 
11787 We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response said Colorado attorney general Gale Norton 
11788 Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd 's agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado 
11789 In addition she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional future liabilities 
11790 Meanwhile an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 Names in California is still pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Chiate of the American Names Association said 
11791 That lawsuit which seeks rescision and restitution was dismissed in a U.S. district court 
11792 That case is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us Chiate said 
11793 The individual Names however now must decide whether to accept Lloyd 's settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation 
11794 Chiate said he has advised Names that they must make individually a risk benefit analysis 
11795 Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing Lloyd 's two to three times more than Lloyd 's is now willing to accept he said 
11796 But in rejecting the offer the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation he said 
11797 German police made Nazi gestures officials say 
11798 NUREMBERG Germany 1996-08-28 
11799 German riot police made Nazi gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions the Bavarian Interior Ministry said on Wednesday 
11800 The ministry declined to detail gestures the Nuremberg-based policemen had made at the August 13 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry 
11801 A spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city where dictator Adolf Hitler held some of his most infamous Nazi party rallies in the 1930s said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public

11804 A motorist threatened a fellow driver with a starting pistol as he overtook him illegally in the inside lane on a motorway near Berlin and was photographed in the act by the driver 's wife prosecutors said on Wednesday 
11805 Prosecutors in the city of Potsdam said the 32-year-old man drew alongside the other car at about 110 kph 70 mph and aimed his pistol at the driver

11807 The man has been charged with dangerous driving coercion and threatening behaviour 
11808 German prosecutors file sex tourism charges 
11809 BERLIN 1996-08-28 
11810 Berlin prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against two German men for sexually abusing children in Thailand and distributing pornographic films and pictures of their degrading acts 
11811 The case is one of only a handful in which authorities have managed to track down suspects under a law which lets them pursue Germans who commit sex offences abroad 
11812 The pair identified only as 43-year-old clerk Dieter U and businessman Thomas S 33 are alleged to have carried out acts of sexual indecency with children as young as 10 years old between 1994 and 1995 
11813 Their videos included pictures of one of the accused tying up a Thai boy and performing acts of sadistic torture on him prosecutors said in a statement 
11814 In another scene a young girl performed oral sex with an unidentified adult man 
11815 The new law was introduced with much fanfare in 1993 
11816 But prosecutors face huge difficulties in gathering evidence and bringing witnesses to testify in a German court and only one person has so far been convicted under the law 
11817 Investigators are probing several other cases 
11818 The Berlin prosecutors said they had been alerted to the two men by customs officials who intercepted packages containing pornographic photographs and order forms

11841 Stephanie of Monaco 's husband snapped cavorting 
11842 ROME 1996-08-28 
11843 Two Italian magazines published pictures on Wednesday of Daniel Ducruet Princess Stephanie of Monaco 's husband and former bodyguard cavorting naked with another woman by a poolside in France 
11844 The magazines Eva Tremila and its sister publication Gente printed up to 26 pages of photos of the woman undressing Ducruet the pair embracing on a sunbed and finally both naked 
11845 Eva Tremila said other even more explicit photos were taken but it did not print them 
11846 The magazines named the woman as Fili Houteman a 26-year-old French singer and dancer in a Belgian cabaret club 
11847 The photographs an Italian exclusive raised eyebrows in the tiny principality where Stephanie 's father Prince Rainier had long disapproved of his daughter 's choice of husband 
11848 Stephanie had two children with Ducruet before their marriage in July last year 
11849 Stephanie Caroline and Albert are the children of Rainier and former Hollywood screen goddess Grace Kelly who was killed in a car crash in 1982 
11850 We have seen the photos but for the moment the palace has no comment a spokeswoman for Prince Rainier told Reuters 
11851 The magazines said the photographs were taken in Cap de Villefranche some 15 km nine miles from Monte Carlo 
11852 Gente said Ducruet a keen racing driver met Houteman during a race in Belgium and photographers had been on their trail ever since 
11853 The magazine said video cameras had also been used to film the couple and that a sound-track existed

11922 SYDNEY 1996-08-28 
11923 British-based investment company Guinness Peat Group Plc GPG said on Wednesday it expected a strong full year result 
11924 We think we 're in a position to produce a strong result however a lot of our profitability must inevitably depend on a number of company results said GPG director Garry Weiss 
11925 GPG earlier said its net profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 9.77 million pounds from 6.93 million in the previous first half 
11926 The company did not declare an interim dividend as in the previous year 
11927 Weiss said the Australian share market had been somewhat negative for much of 1996 and this had some effect on the company 's first half results 
11928 However it certainly is a very pleasing result for the first six months he said 
11929 Weiss said most of the company 's half year earning stemmed from the sale of its 50 percent stake in Physicians Insurance Co of Ohio 
11930 He said the company decided to sell its U.S. investment in order to consolidate investments closer to its administrative base 
11931 GPG said its stakes in Tyndall Australia Ltd and Mid-East Minerals Ltd both contributed strongly to GPG 's first half earnings

11944 It is one step short of an emergency situation a police spokesman said via telephone from a command post in the bush 
11945 We have not had any sightings but we suspect he is armed possibly with a .22 rifle and or a self-loading shotgun 
11946 He is considered extremely dangerous he said

11964 Khmer Rouge 's Ieng Sary confirms break with Pol Pot 
11965 ARANYAPRATHET Thailand 1996-08-28 
11966 Dissident Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary confirmed on Wednesday that he had broken with Pol Pot and other hardliners of the guerrilla group and had formed a rival movement 
11967 Ieng Sary said in a written statement the first since his split with Pol Pot earlier this month that the new movement to be called the Democratic National United Movement DNUM would seek an end to civil war and work towards reconciliation with the Cambodian government 
11968 I would like to inform you about my decision to break away from Pol Pot Ta Mok Son Sen 's dictatorial group he said in a copy of the statement obtained by Reuters 
11969 We believe that our country will be reduced to nothing if the Khmer people continue to fight against each other indefinitely .... 
11970 For this reason we decided to break away from that dictatorial group and found a movement named Democratic National United Movement he said 
11971 Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the mass genocide in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge rule of terror between 1975-1979 when over a million people were executed or died of starvation disease or overwork in mass labour camps

11979 MOF 's Kubo says believes BOJ rate policy unchanged 
11980 TOKYO 1996-08-28 
11981 Japan 's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes that the Bank of Japan 's BOJ interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank 's tankan survey 
11982 The BOJ released the August tankan its quarterly short-term corporate survey in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened 
11983 However Kubo said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy 
11984 The question is what the BOJ is going to do with its interest rate policy 
11985 The BOJ governor has made it clear that the BOJ 's policy is aimed at ensuring basis for economic recovery 
11986 I believe this policy has not changed he said 
11987 Asked if a supplementary budget for 1996/97 was needed to support the economy Kubo said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget 
11988 I do n't think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged Kubo said 
11989 The economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace 
11990 Kubo said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-September of Japan 's gross domestic product for the April-June quarter 
11991 I would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of 1996 he said 
11992 China says militant Japan must face war past 
11993 BEIJING 1996-08-28 
11994 China on Wednesday called on Japan to acknowledge its wartime past and put a stop to a tide of resurgent militarism to prevent similar atrocities in future 
11995 Some Japanese are still unrepentant about the atrocities committed by the Japanese militarists during the war said a commentary in the official China Daily 
11996 If they are still undecided whether the war Japan launched was aggressive in nature it will be difficult to tell whether they will do the same again the newspaper said 
11997 China raised indignant protests after several Japanese cabinet ministers visited a shrine dedicated to their country 's war dead on August 15 the 51st anniversary of Japan 's World War Two surrender 
11998 Numerous Japanese politicians have tried to whitewash their country 's war atrocities in recent years the commentary said 
11999 China estimates 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops from 1931 to 1945 
12000 The Japanese have never genuinely apologised for their wartime crimes the commentary said 
12001 Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto marked the August 15 anniversary by expressing remorse for foreign victims of Japan 's World War Two atrocities 
12002 Japan coalition party leader plans to resign 
12003 TOKYO 1996-08-28 
12004 The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion party officials said on Wednesday 
12005 The officials said New Party Sakigake President Masayoshi Takemura finance minister until the beginning of this year promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member 
12006 They said the date of Takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials 
12007 The Sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto 's Liberal Democratic Party LDP the biggest grouping and the Social Democratic Party 
12008 But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election 
12009 The dispute pits Takemura who founded Sakigake in 1993 as a reform-oriented LDP splinter group against party official Yukio Hatoyama who says he will leave Sakigake to form a reformist political group next month 
12010 Hatoyama the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old Takemura pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force 
12011 Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDP-dominated coalition 
12012 The presence of Takemura whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer has stalled Hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp analysts said 
12013 Media reports say that at most 10 of 23 Sakigake members joined by a handful of Social Democrats will follow Hatoyama when he bolts far short of the 50 lawmakers needed to topple Hashimoto 's eight-month-old government 
12014 Hashimoto who returns from a 10-day Latin American tour on Saturday must call polls by mid-1997 and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election 
12015 But many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October

12064 With 307 days to go before the British colony reverts to China the Hong Kong media focused mainly on domestic issues concerning alleged pressure on a judge cross straights relations and the democratic lobby 's relationship with Beijing 
12065 The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO said Taiwan 's government could not hope to stem the island 's economic and trade exchanges with China 
12066 The paper said that using administrative power to limit economic activities across the Taiwan strait would not work 
12067 MING PAO DAILY NEWS said it hoped Chinese officials would soon open dialogue with Hong Kong 's Democratic Party and the newly-established democracy lobby Frontier in order to ease anxieties in the lead-up to the handover 
12068 The English language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said the judiciary needed to take swift and decisive action in investigating the allegations that a judge had been subjected to pressure in a New Zealand immigration case involving allegations of fraud 
12069 The independence of the judiciary and the rule of law were of paramount importance to Hong Kong 's survival as a business centre 
12070 The Chinese language daily HONG KONG ECONOMIC TIMES said the Legal Department had been indecisive in its handling of the judge 's case 
12071 Such hesitancy on the part of the government had damaged public confidence in the rule of law the paper said

12100 BONN 1996-08-28 
12101 Iran has asked Germany to extradite its former president Abolhassan Banisadr for alleged hijacking an Iranian embassy spokesman said on Wednesday 
12102 Banisadr angered Tehran last week by accusing top Iranian leaders of ordering the assassination of Iranian Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992 
12103 He made the allegations at the trial of an Iranian and four Lebanese accused of carrying out the attack 
12104 An Iranian embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that Iran had formally requested Banisadr 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee Iran in July 1981 
12105 We submitted the request three or four days ago he said 
12106 German authorities could not immediately be reached for comment 
12107 Banisadr lives under round-the-clock security in France fearing Tehran could make an attempt on his life 
12108 He is due back in Berlin on September 5 to continue his testimony which has backed up German prosecutors allegations that Tehran ordered the attack on the exiled leaders 
12109 Three dissidents and their translator were killed in the gangland-style machinegun attack 
12110 Iran has warned Germany that bilateral relations could suffer if it pays heed to the testimony of Banisadr an architect of Iran 's Islamic revolution who has been a sworn enemy of Tehran since he fell from favour after a year as president

12119 ISS says agreed sale of U.S. unit 
12120 COPENHAGEN 1996-08-28 
12121 Danish cleaning group ISS on Wednesday said it had signed a letter of intent to sell its troubled U.S unit ISS Inc to Canadian firm Aaxis Limited 
12122 An ISS statement said that Aaxis with year-end 1996 assets of US$ 10.9 million and equity of $ 10.5 million would be listed on the Montreal stock exchange but did not say when 
12123 It said that under the sale agreement full financial details of which were not revealed ISS would acquire a 25 percent stake in Aaxis which would become an associated company within the ISS group trading under the ISS name and logo 
12124 ISS Inc senior management would continue to run the business under the new owners it said 
12125 Danish analysts recently estimated ISS Inc 's sale value at up to $ 118 million 
12126 ISS said that the deal included ISS Inc operations in Mexico and the sale of ISS Inc interests in Brazil would be discussed 
12127 On August 15 ISS published first half 1996 results showing a two billion crown loss caused by falsified accounts in ISS Inc and said that charges and provisions earlier estimated at $ 100 million would have to be increased to $ 146 million 
12128 It also wrote down all ISS Inc goodwill and Wednesday 's statement said that the Aaxis purchase would not necessitate further write down if the sale were completed according to the terms of the letter of intent

12130 Iraq balks at U.N. staff for oil-for-food deal 
12131 Evelyn Leopold 
12132 UNITED NATIONS 1996-08-28 
12133 Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring 
12134 In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff which Baghdad has to finance surpasses funds allocated for electricity water sewers education and agriculture 
12135 At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990 
12136 The Iraqi statement said the United States was interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified 
12137 Iraq 's deputy ambassador Saeed Hasan noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted 
12138 Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the U.N. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reports that arrangements are in place 
12139 The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs DHA which has to coordinate the distribution of food medicine and other goods increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States 
12140 According to U.N. officials and diplomats Iraq would have about $ 1.13 billion to spend for food medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted 
12141 The cost of the U.N. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 31 million 
12142 In addition another $ 12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses such as oil experts and administrative costs 
12143 For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed 1,190 people including 267 international staff and 923 Iraqi support staff 
12144 Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government 
12145 Another 203 international staff and 325 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country 
12146 There are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows 32 customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts 
12147 Yasushi Akashi the DHA undersecretary-general told the Security Council last week that the financial requirements to support the humanitarian programme represent a very modest percentile of the total 
12148 roughly 3 percent

12162 EU Commission cool on changing beef cull plan 
12163 BRUSSELS 1996-08-29 
12164 The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign 
12165 Obviously we are interested in this research 
12166 We will ask the EU scientific and veterinary committee to examine it Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters 
12167 But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its 14 EU partners 
12168 We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible 
12169 I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases Kiely said 
12170 We will look at our approach to the plan but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered he said 
12171 We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered that 's not the issue 
12172 The issue is the protection of consumers health and the rapid eradication of BSE he added 
12173 The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle 
12174 The researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of BSE before 2001 
12175 British farmers leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report 
12176 I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue National Farmers Union president Sir David Naish told BBC radio 
12177 Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners 
12178 The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe accepted this evidence Naish said 
12179 The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease 
12180 The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease CJD from eating BSE-infected beef 
12181 French farmers set up blockades in mad cow protest 
12182 PARIS 1996-08-29 
12183 Thousands of farmers threw up roadblocks across France overnight stopping and checking lorries suspected of importing meat from outside the European Union French radios reported on Thursday 
12184 Radio stations said around 15,000 farmers angered by a fall in beef prices following the mad cow disease crisis staged protests in many areas and blockaded several main roads and motorways 
12185 By 3 a.m. 0100 GMT more than 2,000 lorries had been stopped and searched 
12186 European beef sales plunged after Britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE or mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease CJD

12270 CRICKET CROFT RESTRICTS PAKISTAN TO 225-5 
12271 MANCHESTER England 1996-08-29 
12272 Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped England to restrict Pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday 
12273 Croft who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 
12274 There was also a wicket each for Ronnie Irani Allan Mullally and Darren Gough although there was no joy for Dean Headley who along with Lancashire batsman Graham Lloyd was making his international debut 
12275 After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 
12276 Anwar who struck a superb 176 at The Oval was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on 
12277 Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs 
12278 First Sohail after making 48 was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side 
12279 Wasim who promoted himself to number four in the order followed for six when Croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs 
12280 Shortly after Ijaz was also back in the pavilion for 48 after Irani had repaid Mullally with another good catch at long-on 
12281 Gough later bowled Moin Khan with an inswinging yorker but Inzamam-ul-Haq 37 not out and Salim Malik took Pakistan to 225 for five when the overs ran out

12582 TENNIS MARTINEZ GETS AGGRESSIVE AT U.S. OPEN 
12583 Larry Fine 
12584 NEW YORK 1996-08-28 
12585 Conchita Martinez decided that when in New York do as the New Yorkers do and the Spaniard 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the U.S. Open 
12586 The fourth-seeded Spaniard who is tackling the world class traffic of New York City as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches ran over France 's Nathalie Tauziat 6-1 6-3 on Wednesday to take her place in the third round 
12587 I 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive said the 24-year-old Martinez after crushing Tauziat in just over an hour 
12588 What I 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight 
12589 That would really help 
12590 Martinez the 1994 Wimbledon champion used to struggle at the Open but has come to terms with the noise crowds and chaos 
12591 There is a lot of things that can happen Martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at Flushing Meadows 
12592 Like traffic 
12593 We stay in Manhattan and it 's a long way to come 
12594 The crowds they speak louder or they move 
12595 That does n't happen in other Grand Slams 
12596 That 's where the real champion wins 
12597 You have to concentrate for these two weeks 
12598 It took Martinez four Opens to get as far as the quarters and another four to match that 
12599 Last year Martinez who finished 1995 ranked second in the world reached the semifinals before bowing out to Monica Seles 
12600 Now she feels she is in the swing of things 
12601 I have my own car now and that helps said Martinez 
12602 Sometimes the transportation they the tournament provide gets a little messed up 
12603 This time it did n't happen 
12604 I do the driving and I love it 
12605 It gets my adrenalin going those taxi drivers 
12606 We change lanes all the time in Barcelona 
12607 I 'm used to it and I like to drive fast 
12608 BASEBALL BRAVES SIGN NEAGLE 
12609 ATLANTA 1996-08-28 
12610 The defending world champion Atlanta Braves with the best record and best pitching in baseball added another weapon Wednesday acquiring Denny Neagle the winningest left-hander in the National League from the Pittsburgh Pirates 
12611 The Pirates who conceded earlier this week they would be forced to trim salary from next season 's payroll received Ron Wright a first baseman at Double-A Greenville ; Corey Pointer a pitcher at Class-A Eugene and a player to be named 
12612 It was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the Braves who already have an 11-game lead in the National League Eastern Division 
12613 In the last 15 days Atlanta has traded for third baseman Terry Pendleton claimed outfielder Luis Polonia on waivers and called up minor-league phenom Andruw Jones all in preparation for their fifth post-season

12660 They will run against quartets from the United States Europe and Africa in a special race at the Berlin Grand Prix meeting to mark the 60th anniversary of Owens 's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the German capital

12662 The participation of Bailey and Fredericks had been known before Thursday

12664 Christie is due to retire from international competition at the end of the season although he may compete for Britain in next season 's European Cup 
12665 Although Christie who is not racing the individual 100 metres in Berlin took his time to agree to run the veteran was clearly delighted to be part of the tribute to the black American 
12666 When five former Olympic 100 champions from 1948 to 1980 who have been invited to watch the race turned up at a news conference on Thursday Christie was quick to put his autograph book in front of the them 
12667 I do n't normally do this but can you please sign he said thrusting an ornate white book in front of Americans Harrison Dillard 1948 Lindy Remigino 1952 Jim Hines 1968 Trinidad 's Hasely Crawford 1976 and Britain 's Allan Wells 1980 
12668 Jesse Owens inspired everyone here and it is great to have a tribute to him 
12669 Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out by the sprinter 's grand-daughter Gina Tillman during the meeting 
12670 Berlin organisers hoped to have American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in last Friday 's Brussels meeting

12726 A total of 116 delegates to Zaire 's National Election Commission CNE were formally installed on Thursday launching another phase of the Central African nation 's much-delayed democratic transition 
12727 The 116 representing political parties in the capital Kinshasa will help organise a voter census a constitutional referendum planned for January and efforts to brief potential voters on what balloting involves 
12728 A total of 9,446 delegates will be deployed throughout Zaire 's 11 provinces for the elections which must be held by July 1997 under the transitional constitution 
12729 Presidential parliamentary and municipal elections are planned for May 
12730 We can meet the required deadlines for organising the elections 
12731 All that is needed is for everyone to show goodwill Commission spokesman Yoka Lye Mudaba told reporters 
12732 Delegates to the commission from the other 10 provinces will be installed progressively from next week with the provinces of North and South Kivu Maniema Shaba and Bandundu having priority he said 
12733 The installation of delegates was initially scheduled for July

12740 Ikimi reiterated his position that the Commonwealth had no mandate to send a fact-finding mission 
12741 The request I have received is for their officials to come and talk to my officials 
12742 We cannot object to people wanting to visit Nigeria Ikimi told Reuters by telephone from the capital Abuja 
12743 The fundamental problem we have with the Commonwealth is our unfair suspension 
12744 Any discussions we have at ministerial level will be a continuation of what we began in London on that 
12745 Before that is accomplished we cannot address anything else 
12746 Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in November after the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists in defiance of international pleas for clemency 
12747 A meeting of Commonwealth ministers in London on Wednesday said it planned to send a team of senior officials to Nigeria as soon as possible to persuade Abuja to accept a fact-finding mission 
12748 The timing of that mission has yet to be determined 
12749 The latest diplomatic row between Nigeria 's military government and the club of Britain and its former colonies erupted over the terms of a visit by Commonwealth ministers to discuss Nigeria 's suspension

12783 NATO releases Serb police crisis easing NATO 
12784 SARAJEVO 1996-08-29 
12785 NATO forces released a group of Bosnian Serb policemen late on Thursday and a tense confrontation appeared to be easing an alliance spokesman said 
12786 The situation in Mahala seems to be very much on its way toward resolution 
12787 My understanding is the Serb police have been released 
12788 In Zvornik we think the situation is winding down as well NATO spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Max Marriner told Reuters 
12789 NATO troops detained 65 Bosnian Serb policemen early on Thursday after they attacked Moslem refugees returning to homes in Mahala a Serb-controlled village on Bosnia 's internal boundary line 
12790 In apparent retaliation for NATO 's detention of the Serbs an angry Serb mob including policemen trapped six unarmed U.N. police monitors and three local aides in their office in the town of Zvornik east of Mahala 
12791 Marriner said NATO forces confiscated 25 long-barreled AK-47 automatic assault rifles from the detained Serbs before setting them free 
12792 Local radio and television there in Zvornik are advising people to step back and take it easy 
12793 We think that when the word about how things are going in Mahala which is about 35 minutes away by road reaches Zvornik that should help Marriner said

12798 Kornblum Milosevic discuss election crisis 
12799 Peter Greste 
12800 BELGRADE 1996-08-29 
12801 U.S. envoy John Kornblum met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding Bosnia 's post-war elections 
12802 The American diplomat arrived in Belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in Bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters 
12803 We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska Bosnian Serb republic which led to this development Kornblum said after three hours of talks 
12804 But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in Bosnia as scheduled on September 14 to bolster the peace process 
12805 Kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic the patron of the Bosnian Serbs to rectify any abuses in the registration process 
12806 Bosnia 's Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved 
12807 Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest 
12808 Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs angry at the postponement of municipal elections have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing 
12809 Kornblum said only elections endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE would be legitimate 
12810 As we have said publicly before if there is any effort to do so hold local elections these elections will not be valid he said 
12811 The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE 
12812 After meeting Milosevic Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital Zagreb 
12813 He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders 
12814 He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat mini-state in western Bosnia 
12815 U.N. police relief workers and NATO officers have reported a rise in political violence across Bosnia in the run-up to the September 14 elections 
12816 Voters will be choosing a three-member presidency and a parliament to rule over a loose union of Bosnia comprised of a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation 
12817 Gazprom rises to 2,901.48 rbls at auction 
12818 MOSCOW 1996-08-29 
12819 A stake of 10 million shares in Russian gas monopoly RAO Gazprom was sold at auction on Thursday at an average 2,901.48 roubles a share up from 2,891.00 roubles a week ago the Federal Securities Corporation FFK said 
12820 Starting price at the auction was 2,746 roubles a share and the 40 lots sold for between 2,840 and 2,998 roubles a share the FFK said in a statement 
12821 The stake represented 0.042 percent of Gazprom 's capital 
12822 The FFK said that since auctions began 139.75 million shares equivalent to 0.59 percent of Gazprom have changed hands 
12823 Gazprom Russia 's biggest company by market capitalisation has massive reserves and potentially huge earnings 
12824 However its 23.6 billion shares are highly illiquid and management permission is required to sell them 
12825 Gazprom has recently tightened these rules making it harder for shareholders to sell to whoever they want when they want 
12826 The company has organised regular auctions of its shares to create an orderly market in the paper 
12827 At the first auction on March 6 shares sold for an average 406.6 roubles each and prices have been rising steadily since then but the rise in price this week and last was much less than in previous auctions 
12828 On the Russian Trading System Gazprom shares rose 25 percent on Thursday to $ 0.375 from $ 0.300 after falling by over a third earlier this week

12831 BELGRADE 1996-08-29 
12832 A policeman has been shot dead in Serbia 's troubled Kosovo province Serbian police said on Thursday

12947 Thai poll shows military wants PM Banharn out 
12948 BANGKOK 1996-08-29 
12949 Thailand 's powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa 's resignation might solve the nation 's political and economic woes an opinion poll showed on Thursday 
12950 Nearly half the 1,617 military personnel surveyed in the Rajapat Institute poll suggested that Banharn resign while about 28 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 24 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government 's problems 
12951 Banharn who leads a six-party 13-month-old coalition government faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month 
12952 The prime minister who has already lost one coalition partner this month is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners 
12953 The poll conducted earlier this month after Banharn 's coalition completed one year in office showed the military would prefer General Chatichai Choonhavan a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in February 1991 as prime minister 
12954 Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh head of coalition member the New Aspiration Party was the second choice for prime minister the poll showed 
12955 Banharn came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes 
12956 Nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere and 65 percent blamed the government 's poor performance for the country 's economic slowdown 
12957 The opinion of the military in Thailand which has seen 17 coups or attempted coups since the country switched to parliamentary democracy from absolute monarchy in 1932 always carries weight in the political scene despite officials vows to distance the military from politics

12973 Scandal hits Clinton campaign at vital moment 
12974 Michael Conlon 
12975 CHICAGO 1996-08-29 
12976 President Bill Clinton 's triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention a vital moment in his bid for a second term was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal 
12977 Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday 
12978 The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made 
12979 Dick Morris is my friend and he is a superb political strategist Clinton said in a written statement 
12980 I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years 
12981 Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue 
12982 The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton 's lead over Dole in the opinion polls 
12983 Senator Dianne Feinstein a California Democrat called it a big bump in the way of the Clinton campaign 
12984 It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president Feinstein said 
12985 Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at 8 p.m. EDT midnight GMT 
12986 The 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers 
12987 Republicans hope to seize on the character issue to bolster Clinton 's challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign 
12988 Speaking in Santa Barbara California Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course would make Clinton drift back to the left 
12989 Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is Dole told reporters 
12990 Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt 
12991 Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles km from the convention hall working on his speech 
12992 It was apparently neglected on his long whistle-stop train trip to the convention during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland 
12993 He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest 
12994 But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television He 's really fired up 
12995 He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years and what he would like to see done in the next four years she said 
12996 He 's very excited about this convention 
12997 He 's excited about the campaign 
12998 But more than that he 's very resolute about what he wants to do 
12999 I do n't take anything for granted 
13000 I always expect elections to get close 
13001 I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then she said of the November 5 election date 
13002 Clinton is leading Dole by as much as 15 points according to some polls 
13003 The campaign pits Dole a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service but stilted speaking style against the glib and confident Clinton who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience

13016 Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy 
13017 PHILADELPHIA 1996-08-29 
13018 University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals 
13019 Word of the findings to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal Human Gene Therapy came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research 
13020 Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials 
13021 Nevertheless a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release 
13022 Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat 
13023 Death strikes in early adulthood 
13024 Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin 
13025 In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene 
13026 The virus which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes 
13027 In the experiment between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing 
13028 Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures but not in live animals the university said 
13029 The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue

13058 Help-wanted ad index fell in July 
13059 NEW YORK 1996-08-29 
13060 The help-wanted advertising index fell in July the Conference Board said Thursday reflecting the uneven nature of the nation 's labour markets 
13061 The monthly index fell to 83.0 in July against a reading of 85.0 in June the private business research group said 
13062 In July the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine U.S. regions 
13063 The labour market has been expanding throughout 1996 but in a very uneven pattern Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said 
13064 Recent want-ad figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity 
13065 With 2.5 percent gross domestic product growth expected for 1996 new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year 
13066 With the unemployment rate staying close to about 5.5 percent over the last two years there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 5.0 percent by the end of the year Goldstein said 
13067 The July index matched the reading for July 1995 
13068 The greatest declines in the volume of help-wanted advertising were in the New England Mountain and West South Central regions 
13069 The greatest increase was in the East North Central region 
13070 Police seek suspects in Atlantic City jewel heist 
13071 ATLANTIC CITY N.J. 1996-08-29 
13072 Atlantic City police said Thursday they were seeking two men and two women in connection with a $ 690,000 theft of jewelry and cash from a guest of the Showboat Hotel and Casino 
13073 Capt 
13074 Richard Andrews said police were seeking a man shown on a hotel videotape carrying a suitcase resembling the victim 's 
13075 We want to talk to him Andrews said of the man 
13076 A second man and two women also were being sought 
13077 The thefts occurred Sunday when the victim New York jewelry wholesaler Jerry Schein left three suitcases in a closet at Somerset Jewellers in the hotel while he checked out 
13078 While he was gone two women in their mid-twenties and an older man entered the jewelry store and tried to distract store owner Charles McGilley 
13079 When Schein returned two of the suitcases were missing 
13080 They contained $ 650,000 in jewelry and $ 40,000 in cash Andrews said 
13081 He said the man on the videotape did not match the description given by the jewelry store owner 
13082 O.J. Simpson hints at more supporting evidence 
13083 Jackie Frank 
13084 WASHINGTON 1996-08-29 
13085 O.J. Simpson said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month 
13086 The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in June 1994 
13087 He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths 
13088 He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers 
13089 But he added without elaborating hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial 
13090 The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public 
13091 I would love to speak about everything said Simpson who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward 
13092 His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept 
13093 17 will be that he did not kill the victims 
13094 Simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book 
13095 He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home 
13096 I 'm broke 
13097 I am not crying the blues 
13098 I can get along just fine he said 
13099 Whatever you want to send me I need 
13100 He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed Washington church 
13101 Contrary to news reports Simpson said he has received support from both blacks and whites 
13102 He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career only to seek their support after he faced murder charges 
13103 A crowd of 2,000 paid $ 10 a head to hear the former star running back for the Buffalo Bills professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night 
13104 The crowd in the church was wildly supportive showering Simpson with gifts and praise 
13105 But outside dozens of protesters from the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence called for the church to support victims of violence instead 
13106 Clinton adviser Morris announces resignation 
13107 CHICAGO 1996-08-29 
13108 President Bill Clinton 's top political strategist Dick Morris resigned on Thursday saying he did not want to become an issue in Clinton 's re-election campaign 
13109 In a written statement distributed by the Clinton campaign Morris avoided comment on published allegations that he had engaged in a year-long affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute 
13110 The statement from Morris said that he had submitted his resignation on Wednesday night 
13111 While I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message 
13112 Now I resign so I will not become the issue he said 
13113 The announcement followed a report in the weekly supermarket tabloid Star magazine reprinted in Thursday 's editions of the New York Post that the married adviser had hired a 37-year-old prostitute on a weekly basis while visiting Washington to advise Clinton on his re-election campaign 
13114 I will not subject my wife family or friends to the sadistic vitriol of yellow journalism 
13115 I will not dignify such journalism with a reply or an answer 
13116 I never will his statement said

13118 U.S. surgeon investigated for discarding foot 
13119 CHARLESTON S.C. 1996-08-29 
13120 Health officials said on Thursday they were investigating the discovery of an amputated foot on a beach near Charleston to determine whether a local surgeon had improperly disposed of infectious waste 
13121 The foot which washed up on Sullivan 's Island beach this month was amputated three years ago from a child whose legs were deformed 
13122 The foot had to be removed so the infant could be fitted with a prosthesis 
13123 An orthopedic surgeon was given permission by the child 's parents and the hospital to keep the foot for research and educational purposes 
13124 Health officials said the surgeon told authorities he stored the foot in his freezer at home but the freezer recently broke down and the contents spoiled 
13125 The surgeon who apologised for the incident said he decided to put the foot in a crab trap to remove the flesh 
13126 The foot later washed up on the beach

13159 A European Union sale of 234,324 tonnes of German intervention barley is worth some $ 145 per tonne fob Germany and is mostly destined for Saudi Arabia European grain sources said on Thursday 
13160 The EU 's cereals management committee sold 234,324 tonnes of German intervention barley at a minimum price of 105.07 Ecus per tonne

13163 Traders have said a substantial part of the deal was likely to come from the European Union which enjoys a supply and freight advantage over other producers 
13164 But subtracting freight costs the equivalent fob price of the deal is around $ 142 well below the $ 149 per tonne floor price which the EU put on its barley as news of the deal emerged last week 
13165 Last Thursday the EU sold 34,277 tonnes of German intervention barley at a minimum price of 109.36 Ecus per tonne which was seen as worth $ 149 per tonne fob

13212 We have no doubt that this is one of the rarest of the rare cases not merely due to the number of innocent human beings roasted alive by the appellants but the inhuman manner in which they plotted the scheme and executed it Justice K.T. Thomas said in the verdict by a panel of three judges

13237 SoCal Edison sees 2 power lines back today 
13238 NEW YORK 1996-08-29 
13239 Southern California Edison Co said it expected two 220 kilovolt KV power lines in southern California to resume service later today after being shut late Wednesday because of a wildfire raging north of Los Angeles 
13240 They are expected to be placed in service later today said company spokesman Steve Conroy adding repair crews have been removing smoke and other fire-related residues which had settled on the two lines 
13241 The shutdown of the 220 KV lines reduced by 500 megawatts MW the amount of power which the area received from SoCal Edison 's 1,200 MW Sierra hydroelectric facility he said 
13242 Conroy noted two 500 KV and another 220 KV line running from the Sierra plant to Los Angeles remained in operation and continued to carry some of the production from Sierra to the region 
13243 On Monday the two 500 KV transmission cables were taken out of service also for cleaning for about a day 
13244 Containment of the fire has been difficult because of the hot arid windy weather in the region Conroy said 
13245 The fires keep moving back because of the winds he said forcing the utility to shut those transmission lines for a second time this week 
13246 Local authorities charged a teenager for starting the blaze 
13247 In four days the fire destroyed 20,000 acres of forest land

13257 Sierra Semiconductor jumps on exit plan 
13258 Martin Wolk 
13259 SEATTLE 1996-08-29 
13260 Sierra Semiconductor Corp jumped 23 percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business 
13261 The San Jose Calif. company was up 2-1/8 at 11-3/8 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment 
13262 Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now but it will be a more profitable business said analyst Elias Moosa of Roberston Stephens & Co 
13263 But analysts noted that Sierra still has much painful work ahead of it including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its workforce which currently has 500 people and building up the business of its PMC-Sierra unit which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks 
13264 The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 50 million to $ 80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments 
13265 Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business 
13266 Once you announce your intention to exit a business it becomes a complete buyer 's market he said 
13267 And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as International Business Machines Corp 
13268 As the market develops the question is are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? 
13269 Randall said 
13270 Other analysts were more bullish even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales 
13271 It 's a positive strategic move said Miles Kan of Hambrecht & Quist 
13272 The modem business is a low-margin commodity business he said 
13273 The company 's PMC-Sierra unit generated $ 33 million of the company 's $ 117 million in sales in the first half of the year compared with $ 45 million in sales of modem chips Kan said 
13274 But the PMC unit is far more profitable he said 
13275 Sierra 's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand

13323 Liam caught a taxi back to London saying he had problems at home 
13324 He was believed to be suffering from laryngitis and said he had to go house-hunting with actress girlfriend Patsy Kensit

13336 In the property market it is a case of so far so good a member of SBC Warburg 's property team said 
13337 SBC Warburg said it is maintaining its forecast for five percent growth in rental incomes during 1996 but it has shaved its forecast for capital growth to five percent from six 
13338 The spokesman said SBC Warburg has also put an add recommendation on Slough Estates shares but added that this is a general move not because of the results 
13339 Slough 's chairman Sir Nigel Mobbs added to the bullish mood in the sector saying in a statement that with the prospect of a period of steady economic growth and low inflation ahead there is good reason to believe that the property sector should continue its improvement

13348 Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti began talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank on Thursday on the stalled Middle East peace process officials said 
13349 Kabariti flew by helicopter to Palestinian-ruled Ramallah and after a brief arrival ceremony went into talks with Arafat 
13350 The prime minister 's visit his first trip outside the country since Jordan was shaken by food riots earlier this month came against the backdrop of a Palestinian general strike in the West Bank and Gaza 
13351 Arafat called the four-hour strike which ended at noon 0900 GMT to protest against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem 
13352 Jordan 's official state news agency Petra said Kabariti would hold discussions on the latest developments in the peace process and bilateral cooperation 
13353 Iran says five spy networks destroyed 41 held 
13354 TEHRAN 1996-08-29 
13355 Iranian security forces have broken up five espionage rings in northwestern Iran and arrested 41 people on charges of spying for unnamed countries a daily newspaper said on Thursday 
13356 Jomhuri Eslami quoted the West Azerbaijan province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information photographing strategic sites doing propaganda against state officials and spreading pan-Turkism 
13357 It was not clear if they were the same five spy rings allegedly led by Turkish diplomats that Iran said in April it had broken up in the same area which borders Turkey 
13358 The April arrests were announced shortly after a row in which Tehran asked Ankara to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of spying and Turkey expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles 
13359 Ties between the two neighbours strained also over a military accord between Turkey and Israel which drew strong Iranian objections have improved since Islamist Necmettin Erbakan took over as Turkish prime minister in June 
13360 The daily Iran on Thursday quoted Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan as saying agents arrested 137 people for allegedly spying for Iraq the United States and other unnamed countries in the Iranian year which ended on March 19 
13361 Mideast Gulf oil outlook India holds the key 
13362 DUBAI 1996-08-29 
13363 India will continue to hold the key to the middle distillates product market in the Middle East Gulf in the short term traders in the region said on Thursday 
13364 They said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 1 and are likely to remain strong in the near term 
13365 On the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality 
13366 Some are commanding a very good premium of 95 cents to one dollar 
13367 It 's been 99 cents to Korea 
13368 This will stay at this sort of price premium for a while one said 
13369 But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable the premium is around 45-50 cents 
13370 The differential is not normally as wide as this he added 
13371 Another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 65 and 75 cents 
13372 One trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at Dubai ports demand looked to exceed supply in the near term 
13373 Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 $ 27.70 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday up from $ 27.22 last week 
13374 Dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks before they get a boost in the second half of September from demand for October cargoes 
13375 Gas oil assessed at $ 24.00 $ 24.20 a barrel fob Gulf was little changed on Thursday from last week 's $ 24.10 $ 24.24 
13376 On gas oil in the near term demand and supply are balanced to a bit short there are some enquiries into east Africa and short covering in India said one trader 
13377 The Indians have awarded three cargoes but the question is whether they will come out for more he added 
13378 India has acquired 120,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes bound for the west coast in its October tender 
13379 Traders said the award could be India 's lowest in recent years 
13380 After IOC 's very small purchase of 120,000 tonnes I 'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of October another said 
13381 But traders see the market remaining tight in the short-term with some surplus arising closer to October 
13382 I see an overhang of gas oil further out one said 
13383 Gas oil will remain tight in the short term up to mid-September with the premium of around $ 1 for 0.5 percent sulphur material 
13384 In the second half of September and October we see the premium coming off to 70-75 cents 
13385 Traders said there was not much demand for one percent sulphur material gas oil with the premium at 40 to 45 cents

13472 A freed black man writes to his still-enslaved wife a mother pleads with Abraham Lincoln on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the U.S. Civil War back to life 
13473 Working in the basement of the National Archives members of the Civil War Conservation Corps are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the North so that they can be preserved on microfilm 
13474 The faded documents have been stowed away in the Archives since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day 
13475 Each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information enlistment papers muster rolls medical records discharge certificates letters and photographs 
13476 Since the project began almost two years ago corps volunteers have focused on African American troops preparing records in time for the unveiling in Washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war 
13477 More than 185,000 black soldiers fought and 37,000 died 
13478 In one letter a black soldier heading South wrote his wife though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom 
13479 I would like to no sic if you are still in slavery if you are it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty 
13480 Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me 
13481 In another letter dated January 1865 a well-to-do Washington matron wrote to Lincoln to plead for her son who faced a dishonourable discharge from the Army 
13482 James is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly while those who have done nothing for the cause are free she wrote 
13483 Lincoln 's notation on the letter read If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment I will pardon and send him 
13484 The soldier was subsequently pardoned 
13485 While the letters speak to the anguish of separation a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war 
13486 In a picture required for his military discharge Pvt 
13487 Lewis Martin with haunted eyes posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg blown off during a battle at Petersburg Virginia in July 1864 
13488 The work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture said John Simon professor of history at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and editor of Gen 
13489 Ulysses Grant 's papers 
13490 These writings are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove 
13491 This is the first generation of African Americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment Simon said 
13492 I think there 's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war said Edward Smith director of American Studies at American University in Washington 
13493 The war between the North and South raged for nearly four years claimed the lives of half a million Americans and forever seared the nation 's consciousness 
13494 Southern records have already been preserved 
13495 They were put on microfilm about 30 years ago through a grant from the United Daughters of the Confederacy 
13496 The Civil War Conservation Corps is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year 
13497 Director Budge Weidman who has shepherded the project from the beginning predicts it will take up to a decade to complete 
13498 The work was inspired by a National Park Service plan to put computer databases at Civil War battlefields across the country so that Americans might research their ancestors 
13499 The records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day

13505 New bomb attacks on Corsica despite crackdown vow

13507 AJACCIO Corsica 1996-08-29 
13508 Separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by Paris police said on Thursday 
13509 In the latest in a wave of attacks a two kg four lb bomb seriously damaged two floors of Agriculture Ministry offices located just 50 metres yards from a police station in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio 
13510 No one was hurt 
13511 A second device packed with five kg 10 lbs of explosive was defused before it could go off police said 
13512 The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new get-tough policy by Paris toward the separatists who seek greater autonomy 
13513 Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given firm orders to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice 
13514 Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed 
13515 The latest bombing close on the heels of the new orders brought charges that police were powerless 
13516 No searches no arrests no police reinforcements visible on the island despite the ministry 's promises the daily France-Soir lamented 
13517 On the island as at the Place Beauvau the Interior Ministry 's Paris address people are well aware who is who and who is doing what 
13518 It is time to end this nightly farce said the pro-government daily Le Figaro in an editorial 
13519 No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday 's incidents which brought to 23 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-August when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce 
13520 Corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence principally directed against government targets for two decades 
13521 The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in Corsica 
13522 The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government 
13523 Sweden 's OM to open London forest products bourse 
13524 STOCKHOLM 1996-08-29 
13525 Swedish options and derivatives exchange OM Gruppen AB said on Thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in London in the first half of 1997 
13526 Together with subsidiaries OMLX the London Securities & Derivatives Exchange and OM Stockholm OM Gruppen will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 1997 OM Gruppen said in a statement

13529 PULPEX was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between OM and representatives of the forest industry the company said 
13530 Huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers profitability unpredictable and made investing in new production capacity a risky business 
13531 Without the ability to hedge prices changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players profitability OM said 
13532 It said global production of pulp amounted to around 200 million tonnes per year of which around 20 percent or 40 million tonnes was sold on the spot market 
13533 At current prices the value of this production was around $ 25 billion 
13534 PULPEX will be both a marketplace and a clearing house OM said adding that the British Securities and Investments Board had been informed of OM 's plans 
13535 PULPEX 's clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by OM Gruppen to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations

13640 INTERVIEW-T&N untroubled by margin pressure 
13641 LONDON 1996-08-29 
13642 The chairman of British-based components and engineering group T&N Plc said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets 
13643 In an interview following its first-half results which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past Sir Colin Hope said T&N had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets 
13644 Looking at market prospects he said I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half 
13645 It 's very difficult to predict the market trend this year 
13646 It could be better or it could be worse Hope added echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries 
13647 You can see anxieties in Germany and France in particular beginning to grow and develop 
13648 America however is looking a little better he said 
13649 Compared with the end of last year when T&N predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 Hope said I think the difference now is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half 
13650 Against this background Hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago 
13651 I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking the fairly mixed customer demand and the fact that we sold the southern African mines actually is not bad 
13652 It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again he added saying We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle 
13653 We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances we 're rather used to it 
13654 And we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things Hope said 
13655 When the profit figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction he added 
13656 Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of German piston maker Kolbenschmidt which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles Hope said T&N 's confidence continues to improve that it may eventually be able to proceed

13658 Earthquake jolts New Zealands South Island 
13659 WELLINGTON 1996-08-29 
13660 An earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale shook New Zealands upper South Island on Thursday but there were no reports of injuries Television New Zealand said 
13661 It said the quake centred near the small town of Waiau was strongly felt in the cities of Nelson and Christchurch 
13662 Some minor damage had been reported in the spa town of Hanmer 
13663 New Zealand is prone to frequent earthquakes but they rarely cause major damage

13665 Hong Kong 's Tsang sees growth smooth transition 
13666 Mark Trevelyan 
13667 WELLINGTON 1996-08-29 
13668 Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year 
13669 Tsang who made the remarks during a visit to New Zealand also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the Hong Kong dollar pegged to its U.S. counterpart and said negotiations with China on next year 's budget were going smoothly 
13670 Hong Kong 's economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter down from 5.9 percent a year earlier and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year 
13671 Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the Hong Kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday 
13672 Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch 
13673 There will be fluctuations in individual years but it wo n't be a big margin he said 
13674 He said inflation was under control and the Hong Kong dollar was rock solid 
13675 Its link to the U.S. dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years 
13676 There 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change 
13677 A lot of investment in Hong Kong some of which is by China is predicated on the link continuing 
13678 Britain will hand over Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 1997 
13679 Tsang said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on Hong Kong 's 1997-98 budget which will span the transition period had gone smoothly 
13680 None of our basic precepts have been challenged 
13681 Hong Kong will retain its own currency after the handover run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves 
13682 It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to Beijing Tsang said 
13683 He described the condition of the property market as very good indeed 
13684 You know we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years 
13685 Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures but they are not draconian measures and we brought it down to earth 
13686 Tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce 
13687 The government would put land on the market to stop rentals going through the roof but this would mean reclamation with possible environmental problems 
13688 There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb consistent with our economic growth rate he said in reference to the property market

13691 TAIPEI 1996-08-29

13693 The Taiwan dollar fell in early trade on month-end U.S. dollar demand but the downtrend was later reversed as Taiwan dollar liquidity tightened 
13694 Banks do not want to hold big U.S. dollar positions at this moment said one dealer adding that the rate was likely to hover around current levels 
13695 The rate closed at T$ 27.482 against Wednesday 's T$ 27.495

13702 The Nikkei is testing support at the 20,500 level

13748 JAKARTA 1996-08-29 
13749 Indonesia sought on Thursday to play down a fire bomb attack on a U.S. consulate earlier this week saying it was being treated as a criminal rather than a political act the official Antara news agency said 
13750 The police are still investigating the incident 
13751 It is evident the happening is not politically motivated but just an ordinary criminal act the news agency quoted East Java military commander Major-General Utomo as saying 
13752 The Tuesday morning attack on the consulate in Indonesias second largest city of Surabaya caused slight damage to a guard house before being quickly extinguished a spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Jakarta 700 km 430 miles west of Surabaya said on Wednesday 
13753 No one was injures he said 
13754 Nobody should try and exaggerate it by calling it a bomb because it was just a molotov cocktail Utomo said 
13755 He said police were investigating the incident and patrols around diplomatic offices in Surabaya would be stepped up

13766 HK civil servants contest ban on China panel 
13767 HONG KONG 1996-08-29 
13768 Senior Hong Kong civil servants were given the go-ahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the Beijing-backed panel to choose the territory 's first post-handover leader and lawmakers 
13769 The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September 11 three days before the nomination period for the Selection Committee closes 
13770 The government maintains the ban announced earlier this month is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy 
13771 Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights 
13772 The 400-strong Selection Committee will select Hong Kong 's future chief executive to replace the British governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which Beijing plans to dissolve 
13773 Hong Kong a British colony for more than 150 years will be handed back to China at midnight on June 30 next year 
13774 China intends to dismantle the territory 's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes Britain 's recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber a decision that has generated considerable controversy 
13775 The judicial review sought by directorate-grade bureaucrats will apply to only about 1,000 of the approximately 33,000 civil servants affected 
13776 Police unions are not contesting the ban which affects all 27,000 officers and nor are the very top tier of Hong Kong 's mandarin class the policy secretaries 
13777 More than 16,000 application forms for places on the Selection Committee have been handed out since the nomination period opened 
13778 It closes on September 14

13781 Singapore Refining Company SRC is expected to shutdown its 60,000 barrel-per-day bpd crude distillation unit CDU in September an industry source said on Thursday 
13782 They think something is stuck the source said 
13783 But nothing has been decided as they are still waiting for an X-ray machine to determine the problem 
13784 The source said the problem was discovered during the past month during which time CDU No.3 's production has varied from maximum capacity of 60,000 bpd to as low as 40,000 bpd depending on the crude being run 
13785 We are having a lot of problems said a source 
13786 An earlier problem with CDU No 
13787 3 arose on July 24 when an industry source said the CDU would be closed down briefly in August for repairs to a heat exchanger 
13788 But by mid-August a company spokesman said repairs had been carried out without any shutdown

13868 A preview of the second half of 1996 does not reveal any signs of a significant improvement in market conditions Lenzing said in a statement released ahead of its earnings conference 
13869 For the first six months of the year Lenzing said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period 
13870 The group attributed the first-half losses to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres as well as sluggish economies in the West

13872 Algeria faults Britain over Islamists gathering 
13873 PARIS 1996-08-28 
13874 Algeria fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas attacked Britain on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in London 
13875 The Islamist gathering due to be held in London on September 8 has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like Egypt which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists 
13876 British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist Hamas as well as the banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front FIS are among those radical Islamists attending the conference 
13877 A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that Algeria has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world 
13878 Algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism the spokesman said adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in Algiers for clarifications 
13879 The Algerian ambassador in London has also asked for clarification from the Foreign Office over the meeting of Islamist groups 
13880 Algeria said they are clearly working to undermine the stability of Arab countries 
13881 British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday from Pakistan his government would only take action against the planned Islamists gathering in London if British law was broken 
13882 People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain he said 
13883 An estimated 50,000 people including more than 110 foreigners have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when authorities in Algeria cancelled a general election in which FIS had taken a commanding lead

13887 Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins 
13888 Donna Sells 
13889 NEW YORK 
13890 The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected 
13891 Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar 
13892 Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week 
13893 Should Rubin leave Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him 
13894 Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan 
13895 Obviously under the Clinton administration we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies said Chris Widness an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. Under Rubin the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar 
13896 That strategy backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 1995 and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 1995 
13897 Currently the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen 
13898 Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs and Co 
13899 Inc 
13900 Rubin has done a fine job in that position said Michael Faust a portfolio manager at Bailard Biehl and Kaiser which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds 
13901 Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill 
13902 Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets 
13903 Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening 
13904 As for U.S. Treasury securities Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury 
13905 Although if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States said Widness adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and to a lesser degree bonds 
13906 Still markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results 
13907 If that is true then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency 
13908 If he left the first question people would ask the next guy is What 's your view on the dollar ? 
13909 said Michael Perelstein portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds 
13910 And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing as Rubin if not stronger Perelstein said 
13911 Otherwise you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again

13926 Felicia Ballanger of France confirmed her status as the world 's number one woman sprinter when she retained her title at the world cycling championships on Friday 
13927 Ballanger beat Germany 's Annett Neumann 2-0 in the best-of-three matches final to add the world title to the Olympic gold medal she won in July 
13928 France also took third place in the sprint Magali Faure defeating ex-world champion Tanya Dubnicoff of Canada 2-0 
13929 Ballanger 25 will be aiming to complete a track double when she defends her 500 metres time trial title on Saturday 
13930 The other final of the night the women 's 24-kms points race also ended in success for the reigning champion 
13931 Russia 's Svetlana Samokhalova fought off a spirited challenge from American Jane Quigley to take the title for a second year 
13932 Russia the only nation to have two riders in the field made full use of their numerical superiority 
13933 Goulnara Fatkoullina helped Samokhalova to build an unbeatable points lead before snatching the bronze medal 
13934 Quigley a former medallist in the points event led the race at half distance 
13935 I went so close this time but having two riders certainly gave the Russians an advantage she said 
13936 The first six riders lapped the field which left former world champion Ingrid Haringa of the Netherlands down in seventh place despite having the second highest points score 
13937 Olympic champion Nathalie Lancien of France also missed the winning attack and finished a disappointing 10th

13963 French central defender Antoine Kombouare has completed a 300,000 pounds sterling $ 467,000 move to Aberdeen from Swiss club Sion the Scottish premier division club said on Friday 
13964 Kombouare has signed a two-year contract and will make his debut against Morton in the Scottish League Cup on Tuesday 
13965 But he will be ineligible for the rest of Aberdeen 's UEFA Cup campaign as he has already played for Sion in this season 's Cup Winners Cup 
13966 Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said It 's unfortunate for us that Antoine cannot play in Europe but he will help us achieve things in domestic competition 
13967 I have been watching him for several weeks now and have no doubts he brings real quality to the side 
13968 He has a great deal of experience and I 'm sure he will quickly establish himself in both the team and the affection of our fans 
13969 The 32-year-old defender played seven seasons with Nantes and was with Paris St Germain for five seasons 
13970 He said former PSG team mate David Ginola who now plays for English premier league Newcastle was influential in his move to Scotland 
13971 I 'm a very good friend of David and spoke to him recently about coming to Aberdeen and he was very positive about it Kombouare said 
13972 He said I would really enjoy life there and that I would settle in in terms of football as well 
13973 That and the fact he is only a few hours drive away influenced my decision to come to Aberdeen

14019 CRICKET LEICESTERSHIRE TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY 
14020 LONDON 1996-08-30 
14021 West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship 
14022 Their stay on top though may be short-lived as title rivals Essex Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire 
14023 After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 
14024 Trailing by 213 Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 
14025 Essex however look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley 
14026 Hussain considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements struck 158 his first championship century of the season as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 
14027 By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain 
14028 At the Oval Surrey captain Chris Lewis another man dumped by England continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire 
14029 He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven a lead of 234 
14030 Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat 
14031 Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams 123 and Tim O'Gorman 109 took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 
14032 After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 
14033 They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 
14034 By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three

14095 SOCCER SHEARER NAMED AS ENGLAND CAPTAIN 
14096 LONDON 1996-08-30 
14097 The world 's costliest footballer Alan Shearer was named as the new England captain on Friday 
14098 The 26-year-old who joined Newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling $ 23.4 million takes over from Tony Adams who led the side during the European championship in June and former captain David Platt 
14099 Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss England 's opening World Cup qualifier against Moldova on Sunday 
14100 Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis but new coach Glenn Hoddle said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own 
14101 I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem I 'm sure Alan is the man for the job Hoddle said 
14102 There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it 
14103 In four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this 
14104 but he knows how to conduct himself his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front 
14105 Shearer 's Euro 96 striking partner Teddy Sheringham withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday 
14106 He will probably be replaced by Shearer 's Newcastle team mate Les Ferdinand

14122 Rotor Volgograd must play their next home game behind closed doors after fans hurled bottles and stones at Dynamo Moscow players during a 1-0 home defeat on Saturday that ended Rotor 's brief spell as league leaders 
14123 The head of the Russian league 's disciplinary committee Anatoly Gorokhovsky said on Friday that Rotor would play Lada Togliatti to empty stands on September 3 
14124 The club who put Manchester United out of last year 's UEFA Cup were fined $ 1,000 
14125 Despite the defeat Rotor are well placed with 11 games to play in the championship 
14126 Lying three points behind Alania and two behind Dynamo Moscow the Volgograd side have a game in hand over the leaders and two over the Moscow club 
14127 BOXING PANAMA 'S ROBERTO DURAN FIGHTS THE SANDS OF TIME 
14128 PANAMA CITY 1996-08-30 
14129 Panamanian boxing legend Roberto Hands of Stone Duran climbs into the ring on Saturday in another age-defying attempt to sustain his long career 
14130 Duran 45 takes on little-known Mexican Ariel Cruz 30 in a super middleweight non-title bout in Panama City 
14131 The fight Duran 's first on home soil for 10 years is being billed here as the Return of the Legend and Duran still talks as if he was in his prime 
14132 I want a fifth title 
14133 This match is to prepare me 
14134 I feel good 
14135 I 'm not retiring Duran told Reuters 
14136 But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes lightweight welterweight junior middleweight and middleweight is drawing close to the end of his career 
14137 Each time he fights he 's on the last frontier of his career 
14138 If he loses Saturday it could devalue his position as one of the world 's great boxers Panamanian Boxing Association President Ramon Manzanares said 
14139 Duran whose 97-12 record spans three decades hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against Puerto Rico 's Hector Macho Camacho 
14140 Camacho took a controversial points decision against the Panamanian in Atlantic City in June in a title fight

14296 Larry Fine 
14297 NEW YORK 1996-08-30 
14298 Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open 
14299 The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court 
14300 Next door on the grandstand 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection bad boy Jeff Tarango 
14301 The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 
14302 The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole winning 18 of the last 19 games against India 's Leander Paes 
14303 But the night belonged to the upstarts 
14304 Washington who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals looked poised for another sensational comeback 
14305 O'Brien a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back 
14306 I just kept saying to myself keep giving yourself the best chance to win keep battling maybe something will happen said the 26-year-old O'Brien ranked 65th 
14307 I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home 
14308 The hard-serving O'Brien a former U.S. collegiate national champion fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington 
14309 The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game when Washington after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead 
14310 The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 
14311 You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit 
14312 I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments said Washington 
14313 But I think he served pretty well when he had to 
14314 Tarango whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England Club argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand 
14315 A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American who ate up all the attention 
14316 I 'm an emotional player said the 104th-ranked Tarango 
14317 I think I played very well tonight very focused 
14318 The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators 
14319 I love the crowd if they boo me every day 
14320 It fires me up makes me play my best tennis Tarango said 
14321 I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me 
14322 If tennis was like that every day I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun 
14323 Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics 
14324 He 's always complaining too much said Rios 
14325 But I think it 's not that 
14326 I think I played really bad 
14327 It was tough to play at night 
14328 Balls were going really fast 
14329 I lost too many points that I never lose 
14330 I did n't play my tennis 
14331 I do n't see the ball like I see during the day 
14332 I play an American so that 's why I play at night 
14333 I did n't feel good on the court 
14334 At the end of the match Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute 
14335 I support their enthusiasm Tarango said about the fans 
14336 At the same time they 're cheering blatantly against me 
14337 After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle

14365 MILWAUKEE Wisconsin 1996-08-29 
14366 Nolan Henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger Woods shot 67 in his professional debut 
14367 Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik 
14368 Woods who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship almost eagled the 18th hole 
14369 He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace 
14370 Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time Woods said 
14371 Today I got to play golf 
14372 He added I thought I got off off to a great start 
14373 It was a perfect start 
14374 I 'm in a good position 
14375 Henke who called his round a pleasant surprise finished with six birdies on the final eight holes 
14376 We finally got things going in the right direction he said 
14377 It was my best round in a very long time 
14378 My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often 
14379 That 's always been the worst part of my game 
14380 All in all playing bad 's been a good experience 
14381 Henke who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew Magee during Wednesday 's pro-am has three career PGA Tour victories but none since the 1993 BellSouth Classic 
14382 Estes whose only win came at the 1994 Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place 
14383 No bogeys on the card he noted 
14384 Sometimes I take more pride in that 
14385 Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under including 1993 champion Billy Mayfair who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf and former U.S. Open champ Payne Stewart 
14386 Defending champion Scott Hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back 
14387 Phil Mickelson the only four-time winner on the PGA Tour skipped the tournament after winning the World Series of Golf last week 
14388 Mark Brooks Tom Lehman and Mark O'Meara who make up the rest of the top four on the money list also took the week off

14391 Spanish first division team Deportivo Coruna will be without key midfielder Mauro Silva for Saturday 's game with Real Madrid after FIFA soccer 's world governing body suspended the Brazilian for one game for missing his national side 's European tour 
14392 Silva excused his absence from Brazil 's game against Russia on Wednesday and Saturday 's match with the Netherlands by saying he had lost his passport 
14393 But that did not prevent him from collecting the one-match suspension

14407 Despite the coolish conditions American Olympic champion Gail Devers looked in commanding form in the women 's 100 clocking 10.89 to defeat Jamaican rival Merlene Ottey who was second in 10.94

14666 ROMANIA COMELF H1 PROFIT RISE BELOW TARGET 
14667 BUCHAREST 1996-08-30 
14668 Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei 
14669 But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei 
14670 Comelf 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed 
14671 Comelf based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita manufactures water purification equipment machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment 
14672 In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products the report said 
14673 From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year 
14674 The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits 
14675 Year-on-year inflation initially estimated at 20 percent in December was 33.8 percent in June higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent 
14676 The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July 
14677 The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic

14711 NYMEX heating oil near session lows in pre-close 
14712 NEW YORK 1996-08-30 
14713 NYMEX refined product prices lingered at session lows amid slim volume before the close while crude experienced lackluster buying ahead of the U.S. Labor Day weekend traders said 
14714 There was some profit-taking early on and it 's just sitting there a Texas trader said of heating oil 's and gasoline 's losses 
14715 September heating oil stood 1.02 cents lower at 62.65 cents a gallon 
14716 Heat hit a session low of 62.45 shortly before the close 
14717 September gasoline stood 0.87 cent lower at 62.85 cents a gallon 
14718 Friday 's low in September gasoline was 62.75 
14719 Traders also said players were selling refined products in favor of crude ahead of the front month 's Friday expiry in the refined products 
14720 The October heating oil-to-crude crack spread narrowed to $ 4.22 a barrel from Thursday 's $ 4.58 while the October gasoline-to-crude spread narrowed to $ 3.60 from Thursday 's $ 3.86 a barrel 
14721 October crude stood eight cents higher at $ 22.23 barrel 
14722 Buying interest in crude did not have enough conviction to send it much higher since many players had left early to start the Labor Day holiday weekend traders said 
14723 NYMEX will be closed Monday due to Labor Day

14725 U.S. debt futures end lower shaken by Chicago NAPM 
14726 CHICAGO 1996-08-30 
14727 U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management NAPM index for the Chicago area traders and analysts said 
14728 The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 
14729 Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 
14730 Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures short swaps and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close 
14731 One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads 
14732 Even before the data came out we were seeing put buying one floor trader said 
14733 Meanwhile funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes 
14734 Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets 
14735 However December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent one analyst said 
14736 December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 even though conditions were slightly oversold traders said 
14737 The December calendar spread continued to widen also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation 
14738 While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24 
14739 Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check 
14740 Earlier in the day Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations 
14741 Traders said the Fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news 
14742 The Fed 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data one analyst said 
14743 The revisions to GDP for example may not have attracted a lot of attention 
14744 At the end of pit trade December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32 munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32 December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94 March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33 
14745 Douglas & Lomason shares rise on merger 
14746 FARMINGTON HILLS Mich 
14747 1996-08-30 
14748 Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ 31 a share or $ 135 million 
14749 Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange 
14750 Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price 
14751 The acquisition will beef up Markham Ontario-based Magna 's North American car and truck seating business allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp 
14752 Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers said James Hoey chief financial officer 
14753 Unfortunately in the auto industry these days a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore Hoey said 
14754 This merger makes us much more competitive 
14755 He added that Douglas & Lomason 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger though their future roles have not yet been defined 
14756 Douglas & Lomason 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers which had reduced production at some important customers but are now recovering analysts said 
14757 The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million 
14758 Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers those it deals with directly in half over the next five years 
14759 The deal really levels the seating field somewhat said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co 
14760 It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market 
14761 Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels door panels and other interior components 
14762 Magna Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers including seats instrument panels door panels carpeting and headliners

14769 Iraqi captors of Sudanese jet charged with hijack 
14770 LONDON 1996-08-30 
14771 Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain 
14772 Police said the seven men who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum would appear in court on Saturday 
14773 The Iraqis claimed they were ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam Hussein but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered 
14774 Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq 
14775 The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum 
14776 The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London 
14777 After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers surrender police found only knives and fake explosives

14801 LONDON 1996-08-30 
14802 Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno has quit the ring on medical advice Britain 's Sun newspaper reported on Friday 
14803 An eye specialist told the 35-year-old Bruno that he could be blinded in one eye if he boxed again the newspaper said 
14804 The Briton who lost his World Boxing Council WBC title to Mike Tyson in March said I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in 
14805 I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I 'm glad I had a good innings 
14806 Bruno for years one of Britain 's most popular sportsmen had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye 
14807 Professor David McLeod who examined Bruno told the Sun There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again 
14808 He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that 
14809 Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995 
14810 He was only the third Briton ever to hold a world heavyweight title

14844 Yeltsin endorses Lebed Chechnya peace plan agency 
14845 MOSCOW 1996-08-30 
14846 Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that President Boris Yeltsin who is vacationing outside Moscow had backed security chief Alexander Lebed 's peace plan for Chechnya Interfax news agency said 
14847 Lebed is now in Chechnya solving some problems Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying 
14848 The main thing is his programme 
14849 It was agreed with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin yesterday 
14850 Lebed whom Yeltsin ordered to restore peace in Chechnya struck a military deal with separatist rebels last week ending the worst fighting in the region in more than a year 
14851 He later discussed with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov a framework political agreement to tackle the most painful issue of the 20-month war the future political status of Chechnya 
14852 Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict 
14853 Moscow which wants to keep Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation sent troops to the region in December 1994 to quell its independence bid 
14854 Yeltsin has said any deal should preserve Russia 's territorial integrity 
14855 Itar-Tass news agency quoted Lebed as saying that he would suggest to the rebels that the decision on Chechnya 's future political status be deferred by up to 10 years 
14856 Lebed said he had a telephone conversation with Yeltsin late on Thursday but gave no details 
14857 Yeltsin 's press office could not confirm the call 
14858 Chernomyrdin said on Thursday after a meeting with Lebed and top officials who discussed Lebed 's plans to restore peace in Chechnya that it needed more work 
14859 Lebed Chechens sign framework political deal 
14860 KHASAVYURT Russia 1996-08-31 
14861 Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed said he and rebel military leader Aslan Maskhadov agreed after overnight talks to defer the decision on whether Chechnya should be independent until December 31 2001 
14862 We just now signed a statement and attached the basic principles of relations between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic Lebed told reporters after he and Maskhadov signed a package of documents 
14863 He gave no further details 
14864 That 's it the war is over Lebed told reporters who witnessed the signing 
14865 Lebed said he and Maskhadov agreed to defer by more than five years the painful issue of Chechnya 's political status 
14866 Then with cool heads calmly and soberly we will sort out our relations Lebed said after the late-night signing ceremony in this settlement outside Chechnya 's eastern border 
14867 Tens of thousands of people have died in the war begun in late 1994 after Moscow sent troops to quell Chechnya 's independence bid 
14868 But Russia failed to win control over the whole of Chechnya and its troops suffered several humiliating defeats 
14869 President Boris Yeltsin ordered Lebed to restore peace in Chechnya and gave him unspecified sweeping powers to carry out the mission 
14870 Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that Yeltsin backed a package of proposals Lebed took to the talks 
14871 Ruling Moslem party ends vote boycott 
14872 SARAJEVO 1996-08-30 
14873 Bosnia 's ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections citing assurances provided by a U.S. envoy government radio said 
14874 The Bosnian government radio broadcast said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had reassured SDA officials including presumably its leader Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic whom he met during a Friday visit 
14875 But the radio report did not specify what guarantees if any the U.S. envoy had provided 
14876 Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday August 28 and runs for a week 
14877 Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September 14 
14878 The Party of Democratic Action SDA had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities especially among Serb refugees 
14879 The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices 
14880 The SDA joined by two other parties has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their pre-war place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing

14892 A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic 
14893 The speaker of the Belarus parliament Semyon Sharetsky told Reuters that a draft constitution due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler 
14894 The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko who leads this European state of 10 million people is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution Sharetsky said 
14895 The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president 
14896 Lukashenko 's aides shrugged off Sharetsky 's charge 
14897 If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this Sergei Posukhov Lukashenko 's political adviser told Reuters 
14898 The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim 
14899 Lukashenko 41 won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union 
14900 But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him 
14901 This constitution which has been prepared in secret aims to gather all power in one man 's hands he said 
14902 We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods like this referendum 
14903 Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation 
14904 But nationalist groups scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia 's backing for Lukashenko protested against the deal 
14905 Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact 
14906 The United States last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders Zenon Poznyak and Sergei Naumchik

14909 TAVILDARA Tajikistan 1996-08-30 
14910 Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday 
14911 The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan 's armed forces Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote and now devastated town to show that his forces held it 
14912 He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23 but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains 
14913 Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km two miles east of Tavildara around the village of Layron 
14914 Tavildara 200 km 120 miles east of the capital Dushanbe was in ruins 
14915 Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets 
14916 The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February 
14917 Tajikistan which borders Afghanistan and China has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups 
14918 Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire 
14919 Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men women and their grubby barefoot children 
14920 Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it 
14921 Help me help me said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food 
14922 The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting 
14923 We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting said Rajab Adinayev a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt 
14924 Although shy in front of the government soldiers several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock 
14925 They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital 
14926 One elderly man who declined to give his name said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition 
14927 He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons 
14928 It 's not important who holds this town we just need to stop the war he said 
14929 Polish Foreign Minister to visit Yugoslavia 
14930 WARSAW 1996-08-30 
14931 Poland 's Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati will visit Yugoslavia on September 3 and 4 to revive a dialogue between the two governments which was effectively frozen in 1992 PAP news agency reported on Friday 
14932 During Rosati 's trip the two countries will sign an agreement on mutual protection of investments and a note easing conditions on the granting of visas the agency quoted Foreign Ministry officials as saying 
14933 The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only country of the former Yugoslavia where Poles currently require visas 
14934 They are also to clinch protocols on culture and understanding between the two foreign ministries 
14935 Rosati will meet Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Yugoslav politicians in Belgrade before visiting Montenegro 
14936 Poland revived diplomatic ties at ambassadorial level with Yugoslavia in April but economic links are almost moribund despite the end of a three-year U.N. trade embargo imposed to punish Belgrade for its support of Bosnian Serbs 
14937 Poland is seeking pacts on avoiding double taxation and wants cooperation in fighting crime 
14938 Yeltsin visits wife Naina in hospital Interfax 
14939 MOSCOW 1996-08-30 
14940 Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited his wife Naina in hospital on Friday evening Interfax news agency quoted spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying 
14941 Naina Yeltsin had a kidney operation last Saturday 
14942 Earlier Russian news reports had said Yeltsin 's children and grandchildren had visited the Russian first lady but they said only that Yeltsin on vacation outside Moscow had spoken to her by telephone 
14943 Naina Yeltsin looks well she is active she is clearly getting better Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as saying 
14944 Naina Yeltsin is recovering in Moscow 's Central Clinical Hospital where the president himself was treated twice last year for heart attacks 
14945 Yeltsin 65 has been seen only rarely since he was elected for a second term in office on July 3 although his aides have denied a string of rumours that he has been taken ill again 
14946 Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had travelled from the hospital to spend the night at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow 
14947 He was likely to return on Saturday to his holiday resort a hunting lodge some 100 km 60 miles from Moscow 
14948 Lebed Chechens start peace talks 
14949 KHASAVYURT Russia 1996-08-30 
14950 Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday in this settlement just outside the rebel region 
14951 Lebed who flew into Chechnya earlier in the day said he hoped to sign a framework agreement on a political settlement of the 20-month conflict in which tens of thousands of people have died 
14952 Neither Lebed nor Maskhadov made any statement before the talks 
14953 Russian judge stabbed to death over $ 7 fine 
14954 MOSCOW 1996-08-30 
14955 A Moscow street vendor stabbed to death a woman judge in a city court on Friday after she fined him the equivalent of seven dollars for trading illegally Interfax news agency said 
14956 Interfax said Judge Olga Lavrentyeva 28 on Thursday ordered the confiscation of several overcoats suits and shirts which vendor Valery Ivankov 41 was illegally trading on Moscow streets and fined him 38,000 roubles seven dollars 
14957 The next morning Ivankov appeared in the courtroom and stabbed Lavrentyeva 
14958 The judge died later in hospital 
14959 Interfax quoted Levrentyeva 's colleagues as saying that judges were generally unprotected against criminal attacks 
14960 Cofinec plunges on H1 results

14962 BUDAPEST 1996-08-30 
14963 Shares of France-registered printed packaging company Cofinec S.A. plunged sharply on the Budapest Stock Exchange BSE on Friday despite a mostly reassuring forecast by the group 
14964 Cofinec 's Global Depositary Receipts GDRs opened at 5,200 forints on the BSE down 600 from Thursday 's close following the release of its first half results this morning 
14965 Cofinec CEO Stephen Frater told reporters in a conference call from Vienna on Friday before the opening of the bourse that he expects a stronger second half although the group will not be able to achieve its annual profit goal 
14966 We will not achieve the full 37 million French franc net profit forecast Frater said 
14967 Obviously we cannot make up the unexpected decrease that has been experienced in the first half of the year 
14968 Frater declined to give a forecast for the full year ahead of a supervisory board meeting next week 
14969 Cofinec the first foreign company to list on the Budapest bourse released its consolidated first half figures IAS this morning 
14970 In the conference call Frater said he regarded Cofinec GDRs which are trading below their issue price of 6,425 forints as a buying opportunity 
14971 Obviously at some point it represents a buying opportunity Frater said 
14972 I think the reality is that we operate in emerging markets emerging markets tend to be more volatile 
14973 My message is that the fundamental strategy of the company its fundamental market position has not changed 
14974 The group which operates in Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic reported an operating profit before interest of 21.8 million French francs compared to 34.1 million in the same six months of 1995 
14975 Net profit for the January-June 1996 period was 2.1 million French francs down from 10.3 million in the first six months of 1995 with the bulk of this decline attributable to the performance of Petofi one of its Hungarian units 
14976 Cofinec said Petofi general manager Laszlo Sebesvari had submitted his resignation and will be leaving Petofi but will remain on Petofi 's board of directors 
14977 Until a new general manager of Petofi is appointed 
14978 I will in fact move to Kecskemet site of Petofi printing house for the interim and will serve as acting chief executive officer of Petofi Frater said

14987 Potent landmines found near Colombian presidency 
14988 BOGOTA Colombia 1996-08-30 
14989 Eight claymore mines fitted with powerful C-4 plastic explosives were found stashed in a real estate office on Friday located about two blocks from Colombia 's presidential palace police said 
14990 These are powerful weapons a spokesman with the Municipal Police told Reuters by telephone adding that police had not ruled out a possible terrorist attack on the ornate Casa de Narino presidential palace in Bogota 's historic downtown area 
14991 They could cause serious damage as much as 500 meters yards away from wherever they were detonated the spokesman added 
14992 He said police backed by explosive experts were combing the area in search of other possible weapons or explosive devices 
14993 The police spokeman said plastic explosive like C-4 is not a normal component in claymore mines 
14994 But he said the eight mines seized by police had been specially adapted 
14995 The spokesman declined further comment except to say that two women and a man identified as a lawyer had been arrested in connection with the landmines 
14996 Assault charges dropped against Surinam ex-rebel 
14997 PARAMARIBO Surinam 1996-08-30 
14998 Flamboyant former Surinamese guerrilla leader Ronny Brunswijk walked free on Friday after charges of attempted murder were dropped police said 
14999 Brunswijk had been in police custody for 10 days after Freddy Pinas a Surinamese-born visitor from the Netherlands accused Brunswijk of trying to kill him in a bar-room brawl in the mining town of Moengo 56 miles 90 km east of Paramaribo 
15000 Brunswijk 35 denied the charge and reached an agreement with Pinas after replacing a golden necklace lost in the scuffle 
15001 It was the second time Brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years 
15002 In 1994 he served two months for shooting a thief in the backside 
15003 Brunswijk who led a rebel group against the military regime of Desi Bouterse in the late 1980s is now a successful businessman with mining and logging interests 
15004 Cambodian opposition newspaper editor pardoned 
15005 PHNOM PENH 1996-08-30 
15006 Cambodia 's King Norodom Sihanouk on Friday gave a royal pardon to an opposition newspaper editor who had alleged top-level corruption 
15007 Hen Vipheak former editor of the Sereipheap Thmei New Liberty newspaper stepped through the gates of the run-down French colonial-era T3 prison late Friday afternoon following intervention on his behalf by King Sihanouk 
15008 The Supreme Court had on August 23 sent the opposition Khmer Nation Party steering committee member to jail after upholding rulings by the municipal and appeal courts that handed down a five million riels $ 2,000 fine and one year 's imprisonment 
15009 The judge overturned a decision to shut down Hen Vipheak 's newspaper 
15010 The editor was prosecuted following a May 1995 article alleging top-level corruption 
15011 Sihanouk promised an amnesty to Hen Vipheak along with fellow KNP member and journalist Chan Rattana who was released after serving a week of a year-long jail term in June 
15012 Co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen agreed earlier this week to the king 's request for an amnesty 
15013 Far East Gold Moribund market seen continuing 
15014 Mishi Saran 
15015 HONG KONG 1996-08-30 
15016 Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better 
15017 The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter 
15018 Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce 
15019 Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade 
15020 I was shocked to see these offers coming in again though there 's been no indication of price or volume 
15021 I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force one dealer said 
15022 Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums 
15023 Gold closed down at $ 387.00 $ 387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday versus New York 's $ 387.60 $ 388 finish on Thursday 
15024 Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries 
15025 Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 $ 389 an ounce range dealers said but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October 
15026 I still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October in a retracement of the $ 418 $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year one said 
15027 Silver basis the September contract on New York 's Comex market was expected to find support at between $ 5.12 $ 5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $ 5.25 $ 5.30 they added 
15028 September silver closed up $ 0.004 in New York on Thursday at $ 5.255 an ounce 
15029 Tripoli decks out for coup celebrations

15031 TRIPOLI 1996-08-30 
15032 Libyans are dressing up their capital Tripoli for celebrations on Sunday of the 27th anniversary of the coup which brought Muammar Gaddafi to power 
15033 Green flags and banners praise the great revolution and promise defiance against United Nations sanctions imposed for Libya 's refusal to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie Scotland 
15034 We have chosen the challenge because it is our only option proclaimed one banner on the road to Tripoli airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions 
15035 Huge stadium lights are directed at the city 's Green Square where makeshift stages await Sunday 's festivities 
15036 Three African leaders from Niger Guinea and Ghana are expected to attend the celebrations marking September 1 1969 when a group of young army officers led by a 27-year-old Gaddafi deposed King Mohammed Idris 
15037 The revolution has brought us great achievements 
15038 We are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us improved our lives and given us capabilites Samer Ammar Soliman 42 told Reuters as he came out of Friday prayers 
15039 But some Libyans have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east which has become a hotbed of militant violence 
15040 Tripoli-based diplomats and exiled opponents said Gaddafi 's airforce blasted in July rebel strongholds in the mountainous Jebel al-Akhdar region 
15041 Travellers arriving in Egypt say militants and police officers clash regularly in Benghazi 
15042 At least 20 people were killed in the capital in early July after bodyguards loyal to Gaddafi 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans 
15043 Gaddafi has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners and last year deported thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian workers 
15044 Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up 
15045 Pierre Belec 
15046 NEW YORK 1996-08-30 
15047 For Wall Street this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone 
15048 President Clinton Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth 
15049 Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth 
15050 They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets 
15051 The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship said Hugh Johnson chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. That 's when Wall Street will need to worry 
15052 He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the bidding intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise 
15053 I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market which would include selling by portfolio managers redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would in turn pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock 
15054 This week the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion 
15055 Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls 
15056 Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan 
15057 The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street 's expectations that Washington will balance the budget 
15058 The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services 
15059 During the past four presidential elections the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won 
15060 Ronald Reagan 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984 while Democrat Walter Mondale who promised higher taxes lost 
15061 George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers paychecks 
15062 The trick they said will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury 's 30-year bond the most closely-watched interest rate will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade 
15063 Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election 
15064 The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent 
15065 The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates which has boosted corporate profits 
15066 But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 
15067 The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern said Geraghty 
15068 He said the market reflects the political uncertainty now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls 
15069 Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons 
15070 Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency it could throw the political and to some extent the economic process into chaos Geraghty said 
15071 Right now Wall Street is pondering the candidates 
15072 We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market Geraghty said 
15073 On Friday the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 
15074 For the week it was down 106.53 points 
15075 The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 
15076 For the week it was down 1.55 points 
15077 The Standard & Poor 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 down 15.03 points for the week 
15078 The American Stock Exchange index was down 1.66 points at 559.68 and was off 1.26 for the week 
15079 Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew 
15080 Glenn Somerville 
15081 WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 
15082 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August reports said Friday sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day 
15083 The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion nearly twice the increase that had been expected 
15084 Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose as did order backlogs in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months 
15085 A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July 
15086 A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing 
15087 While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check 
15088 Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted 
15089 It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville Fla 
15090 The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed the nation 's central bank would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running 
15091 The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point raising its yield which moves in the opposite direction from the price to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday 
15092 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday 
15093 A third report from the Commerce Department on July personal income and spending pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half 
15094 It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June 
15095 Incomes from wages salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June 
15096 July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months since January when they were flat 
15097 Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half which should slow economic growth 
15098 The FOMC Federal Open Market Committee has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth Naroff said in a written comment 
15099 The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept 
15100 24 to plot interest-rate strategy 
15101 It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 2-year-old economic expansion 
15102 In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were mixed signals about the economy 's direction 
15103 I think that on balance it is looking a little bit on the strong side Lindsey said 
15104 He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating 
15105 While July consumer spending rose only slightly there were ample indications that consumers remained confident 
15106 The University of Michigan 's August index of consumer sentiment made available on Friday to paying subscribers rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July 
15107 Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production 
15108 The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent annual rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range she said above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary 
15109 New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products 
15110 Orders for durable goods meant to last three years or more rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June 
15111 Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June 
15112 Mexican avocados not expected in U.S 
15113 Maggie McNeil 
15114 WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 
15115 U.S. Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados which are restricted from entering the continental United States will not likely be entering U.S. markets any time soon even if the controversial ban were lifted today 
15116 The opportunity to import Mexican avocados probably wo n't become possible for another year said Paul Drazek senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
15117 We could lift the ban tomorrow but that would not mean anything immediately said Drazek 
15118 We probably would not see avacados come in until next season next November 
15119 The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados 
15120 Under the administration 's proposal the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February 
15121 The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers who are largely concentrated in California 
15122 California growers have charged that removing the restrictions even on a limited basis would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados 
15123 Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation 
15124 Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers 
15125 Under the proposal only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan Mexico the country 's main avocado area would be allowed 
15126 Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies 
15127 The California Avocado Commission which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue 
15128 The administration is still studying the new data and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant the agency could reopen its investigation 
15129 But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position 
15130 From a common-sense view the department should reconsider this plan but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group 
15131 Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible but said there is no timetable they are working under 
15132 It 's a very complicated issue said the Agriculture Department 's Drazek 
15133 We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can based on the best available science 
15134 U.S. Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer 
15135 CHICAGO 1996-08-30 
15136 Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live 
15137 Bernardin 68 underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick 
15138 On Wednesday examinations indicated that the cancer has returned this time in the liver 
15139 I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less a composed Bernardin told a news conference 
15140 In 14 years as Chicago 's archbishop he built a prayerful saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy 
15141 I have been assured that I still have some quality time left he said saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable 
15142 It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody 
15143 Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith he said 
15144 Death is a natural phenomenom 
15145 He said he would serve until the end as cardinal 
15146 Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease although Bernardin 's case was caught early 
15147 Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney parts of his pancreas and stomach small intestine bile duct and surrounding tissues 
15148 He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches 
15149 He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy 
15150 The spare soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese the nation 's second-largest after Los Angeles with 2.3 million parishioners in 1982 
15151 Ironically Bernardin who developed a progressive much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s 
15152 Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse 
15153 Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year 
15154 Bernardin who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972 played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops 
15155 This month he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find common ground among American Catholics 
15156 Previously he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war peace and nuclear arms and for seven years he headed the bishops anti-abortion policy committee espousing a policy describing human life as a seamless garment 
15157 Boatmen 's deal could spark more mergers 
15158 Brad Dorfman 
15159 CHICAGO 1996-08-30 
15160 The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen 's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations 
15161 NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape said Michael Ancell banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co 
15162 Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce 
15163 St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc. a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen 's 
15164 Kansas City Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc. with $ 9.32 billion in assets also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest analysts added 
15165 It focuses more attention on Mercantile Commerce and Roosevelt said James Weber analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons 
15166 Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St 
15167 Louis based thrift 
15168 Now the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile Weber said 
15169 Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment 
15170 Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp. Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois 
15171 Representatives of First Bank Norwest Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions 
15172 KeyCorp contacted by phone would not comment 
15173 With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets 
15174 Boatmen 's was the prize in Missouri where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute 
15175 Boatmen 's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest Weber said 
15176 Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner 
15177 But NationsBank 's bid representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen 's stock was large enough to get the deal done 
15178 I think Boatmen 's was shopping itself and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here you had to make the bid nobody would beat Ancell said 
15179 But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium 
15180 They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen 's 
15181 I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium said Michael Durante analyst at McDonald & Co 
15182 U.S. tight-lipped on Libya 's award to Farrakhan 
15183 WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 
15184 The State Department refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis Farrakhan the U.S. black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by Libya 
15185 I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said 
15186 The view of the U.S. government on Farrakhan 's not accepting any gifts from Libya is well-known 
15187 Davies also noted We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to Libya but he did not elaborate 
15188 The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday denied Farrakhan 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi had pledged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam group after they met last January 
15189 Farrakhan organised last October 's Million Man March that brought thousands of black men to Washington for a peaceful rally 
15190 The Treasury Department said Libya was on the U.S. list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that Tripoli has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland 
15191 That refusal led to the imposition of U.N. sanctions on Libya 
15192 U.S. Gulf rig down by one to 162 in week

15210 Titanic recovery mission is scrapped 
15211 NEW YORK 1996-08-30 
15212 Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the RMS Titanic from the ocean floor a spokeswoman said on Friday 
15213 A 20-ton piece of the Titanic 's steel hull which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland Canada fell back to the bottom of the sea said Erin Purcell of Boston-based Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition 
15214 The piece of hull lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags had been stuck about 200 feet about 70 metres below the water 's surface before it fell she said 
15215 It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped she said 
15216 The steel-hulled Titanic thought to be unsinkable struck an iceberg on April 14 1912 and sank killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board 
15217 The wreck was located in 1985 
15218 Passengers who had paid $ 1,500 and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on Thursday Purcell said 
15219 Bonn appeals for Middle East peace 
15220 BONN 1996-08-30 
15221 The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East 
15222 Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem 
15223 City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally 
15224 But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government were tantamount to war 
15225 Tension has been rising in the region since 
15226 We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said 
15227 All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult he said as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem 
15228 Erdmann told reporters Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank 
15229 The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month 
15230 The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the Middle East process and German-Israeli relations at their meeting on September 9 
15231 Levy 's visit would be the first by an Israeli cabinet minister since Netanyahu 's conservative government took power in une this year the ministry said 
15232 Before Levy 's arrival in Bonn German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe will visit Israel from September 2 to 4 the defence ministry said 
15233 Ruehe planned to meet his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai and Israeli President Ezer Weizman the ministry said 
15234 He was also expected to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu and opposition leader Shimon Peres for talks 
15235 France expels African Air France unions protest 
15236 PARIS 1996-08-30 
15237 France on Friday expelled another African man seized in a police raid on a Paris church as about 100 Air France workers denounced charters of shame used to fly illegal immigrants home 
15238 A Guinean man detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed a spokesman for Air France 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said 
15239 He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits unions said 
15240 Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention 
15241 About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants 
15242 We must obtain a formal commitment from Air France chairman Christian Blanc that no plane no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said 
15243 He said civilians should not be police accomplices 
15244 Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister Alain Juppe 's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets 
15245 The other two were military jets 
15246 Separately Juppe confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration 
15247 Legislation is insufficient in several areas notably in those concerning illegal work Juppe told reporters

15264 German police suspected her aunt 47 and companion 28 were involved in running a child prostitution ring 
15265 Public prosecutors said they had found a list of children 's names and ages at the couple 's flat

15286 Canadian bonds open softer spreads to U.S. shrink 
15287 TORONTO 1996-08-30 
15288 Canadian bonds opened softer on Friday pulled lower by a sinking U.S. market but outperformed U.S. bonds on positive Canadian economic data analysts said 
15289 I think this morning 's Canadian numbers were very supportive of narrower spreads particularly the current account number said Jim Webber director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc 
15290 Canada 's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 fell C$ 0.45 to C$ 101.15 to yield 7.894 percent 
15291 The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 30/32 to yield 7.12 percent 
15292 The spread between benchmark bonds narrowed 77 basis points from 81 basis points at the close of trading on Wednesday 
15293 Statistics Canada on Friday reported Canada 's current account moved to a higher-than-expected C$ 1.15 billion second quarter surplus from a C$ 1.62 billion deficit in the first quarter 
15294 It was the first surplus since the fourth quarter of 1984 
15295 The agency also reported Canada 's real gross domestic product rose a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent in the second quarter or 1.3 percent at an annualized rate 
15296 While the data provided support for Canadian bonds both Canadian and U.S. markets weakened after the release of strong U.S. economic data including a report showing the Chicago Purchasing Managers August index rose to 60 from 51.2 in July 
15297 The purchasing managers number is extremely extremely strong said Webber 
15298 In other news the Toronto Bond Traders Association said it is recommending that dealings in the Canadian bond market end early at 1400 EDT 1800 GMT on Friday 
15299 The Canadian market typically closes early on holiday weekends and Canadian financial markets will be closed on Monday for Labour Day 
15300 In other prices the 7.0 percent of 2006 fell C$ 0.28 to C$ 96.89 to yield 7.437 percent 
15301 The U.S. 10-year benchmark fell 21/32 to yield 6.95 percent

15334 Syria slams Israel on settlements 
15335 DAMASCUS 1996-08-30 
15336 Syria on Friday condemned Israel 's settlement policy and said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was preparing for war with Arabs 
15337 Practices of the Israeli government especially its settlement activities came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause state-run Damascus Radio said in a commentary 
15338 When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart this means that it is preparing for war the radio said 
15339 Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war 
15340 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move 
15341 The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing Israeli government 
15342 Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity Damascus radio said 
15343 It welcomed the international criticism of Israel 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy 
15344 It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success the radio said 
15345 Syria and Arabs have been dismayed by Netanyahu 's refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on Jerusalem as a unifed capital for Israel 
15346 Syria has held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 without achieving a breakthrough 
15347 Egypt police detain 26 suspected Moslem militants 
15348 CAIRO 1996-08-30 
15349 Police have detained 26 suspected members of Egypt 's largest militant group al-Gama'a al-Islamiya Islamic Group government newspapers reported on Friday 
15350 They said police arrested the militants in the eastern Sharqiyah province after capturing their leader Rami al-Saadani in a satellite city outside Cairo 
15351 Al-Akhbar newspapers said the men had been plotting against strategic institutions and prominent individuals but gave no other details 
15352 The newspapers said the men were being interrogated 
15353 State security officials were not immediately available for comment 
15354 More than 960 people have been killed in the armed struggle the Gama'a launched in 1992 to topple President Hosni Mubarak 's government and establish a purist Islamic state in its place 
15355 Israel blocks Palestinian pilgrims progress

15357 AL-RAM West Bank 1996-08-30 
15358 Kamil Jamil did n't have a prayer 
15359 An Israeli roadblock stopped the 38-year-old Palestinian from answering Yasser Arafat 's call to worship at Jerusalem 's al-Aqsa mosque on Friday 
15360 Go home 
15361 There are no prayers today an Israeli soldier yelled at Jamil in Hebrew 
15362 Palestinian President Arafat attacking Israel 's decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on Jerusalem went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to go to the holy city 
15363 Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress 
15364 Palestinians have been banned by Israel from travelling from the West Bank to Jerusalem since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March 
15365 And Israeli checkpoints have circled Jerusalem since 1993 a concrete and constant reminder of Israel 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital 
15366 The PLO wants Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state 
15367 Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks 
15368 They were immediately turned back 
15369 I am heeding Abu Ammar 's Arafat 's call to pray at al-Aqsa and I came 
15370 It is our duty towards al-Aqsa to come and pray Jamil said 
15371 A tourist from Jordan was also told by Israeli soldiers at the al-Ram checkpoint that he could not enter Jerusalem 
15372 We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to Jordan said the tourist Khaled Hijazi 37 
15373 I feel terrible 
15374 I am entitled to see Jerusalem he said 
15375 Some Palestinians took to back roads only to run into waiting Israeli security forces 
15376 The Israelis have no right to prevent us from going to pray 
15377 What kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places ? 
15378 asked Mustafa Hoshiyeh a 27-year-old West Bank labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road 
15379 Abu Ammar Arafat is right 
15380 We have signed a peace treaty with the Israelis but on the ground we see that nothing has changed said 20-year-old Ali Ahmed from Qalandia refugee camp

15414 Consumer spending incomes edge up in July 
15415 Glenn Somerville 
15416 WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 
15417 Consumer spending barely edged up in July the Commerce Department said Friday as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months 
15418 Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June 
15419 Incomes from wages salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June 
15420 Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January when they were flat 
15421 Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks 
15422 The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June 
15423 In July average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment Commerce said 
15424 But more money went into savings accounts as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July 
15425 That was the highest savings rate since October last year when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved 
15426 The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected 
15427 At the same time the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July with widespread gains across most major categories 
15428 Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists 
15429 That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders 
15430 Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks 
15431 In addition the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth 
15432 It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June 
15433 Gains in personal income which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends interest and businesses are essential for funding consumer purchases which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity 
15434 Spending on all types of durable goods which includes cars fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June 
15435 But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion 
15436 Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion

15448 STOCKS SINK AS BOND RATES JUMP ON STRONG DATA 
15449 Blue-chip stocks sank to their biggest loss since mid-July Thursday as fresh signs of a surprisingly strong economy boosted long-term bond interest rates above 7 percent 
15450 The dollar rose slightly against the German mark but edged lower against the Japanese yen 
15451 The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65 its largest drop since July 15 when it closed with a loss of 161 points 
15452 In the broader market declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange 
15453 In the bond market the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond raising its yield to 7.04 percent the highest since July 31 from 6.98 percent at Wednesday 's close 
15454 Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities said Ralph Bloch chief technical analyst at Raymond James 
15455 We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow he said 
15456 I 'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday Sept 
15457 6 so let 's be careful 
15458 Wall Street on Sept 
15459 6 faces the key monthly employment report which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices 
15460 We had two very strong economic reports said David Shulman Salomon Bros 
15461 chief equity strategist 
15462 There are more worries in bond land 
15463 Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July 
15464 The Commerce Department reported that the nation 's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago 
15465 In another report sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months driving prices up in a strong housing market 
15466 Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units the strongest since February when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year 
15467 Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning 
15468 Dick Morris who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents 
15469 Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton 
15470 Morris departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term 
15471 The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks up from 1.4767 late Wednesday 
15472 The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45 
15473 Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by Iraq 
15474 September heating oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon September unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and October crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel 
15475 December cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the New York Cotton Exchange despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key U.S. growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore 
15476 Overseas London 's FTSE 100 index had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below its record of 3,922.1 before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0 a fall of 33.7 points 
15477 In Tokyo the key 225-share Nikkei average shed 156.65 points or 0.76 percent to end at 20,553.16 
15478 Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth 
15479 David Jones 
15480 MILAN 1996-08-30 
15481 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market 
15482 Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi Jiangsu province Shanghai 
15483 The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years 
15484 The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia India and Malaysia 
15485 This is really positive news for Pirelli and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez 
15486 She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets 
15487 Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected 
15488 The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market 
15489 This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 doubling demand for optical cables 
15490 China 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks 
15491 The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera 
15492 Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S. Europe and the Far East 
15493 CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture trading distribution and property with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms 
15494 It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in China 
15495 Dutch bond futures revival delayed EOE 
15496 AMSTERDAM 1996-08-30 
15497 A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system the European Options Exchange EOE said on Friday 
15498 Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system 
15499 It 's not ready yet 
15500 We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters 
15501 He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks 
15502 Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid 
15503 A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed

15505 OSCE defends record over Chechnya peace mission 
15506 BONN 1996-08-30 
15507 The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region 
15508 Flavio Cotti the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem 
15509 The OSCE is completely involved 
15510 But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there said Cotti who is also the Swiss foreign minister 
15511 Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations 
15512 Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev president of the self-declared separatist government 
15513 Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region 
15514 Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia 's borders 
15515 There is no doubt that Chechnya according to OSCE principles belongs to a state called Russia he said pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members sovereignty 
15516 He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a internal issue 
15517 We have a small concept the details of which have yet to be worked out 
15518 Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity said Cotti 
15519 Dutch say no reason to reopen El Al carqo enquiry 
15520 THE HAGUE 1996-08-30 
15521 The Dutch transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma told the country second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an El Al freighter which left 43 dead in an Amsterdam suburb 
15522 She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El Al 's head office in Tel Aviv 
15523 The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted dangerous goods 
15524 Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight 
15525 Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El Al in no way supported the allegations and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident

15527 Armenians Azeris hold peace talks in Germany 
15528 BONN 1996-08-30 
15529 Representatives from Armenia and Azerbaijan held talks earlier this week in Germany on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday 
15530 The source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home 
15531 An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region 
15532 The conflict which began in 1988 claimed over 10,000 lives 
15533 The main subject of the talks was the search for a peaceful solution for Nagorno-Karabakh the source said 
15534 He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany 
15535 Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenian forces pull out but will not accept Armenia 's demands for the independence of the enclave 
15536 Russia 's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam 
15537 Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE and the broad-based Minsk Group of countries led by Russia and Finland 
15538 Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash 
15539 Rolf Soderlind 
15540 LONGYEAR Norway 1996-08-30 
15541 The windblown chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding clouded sky 
15542 Longyear is a town in mourning a close-knit community that has been shattered 
15543 Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport killing all 141 people on board 
15544 It 's a sight I will never forget 
15545 I will remember it for the rest of my life said Stig Onarheim 
15546 He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday hoping in vain to find survivors 
15547 The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday just east of Longyear 
15548 Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board 
15549 Think of all that mixed together with twisted wrecked parts on the slope Onarheim 29 told Reuters 
15550 Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses 
15551 The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden 
15552 Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people but it also feels the loss keenly 
15553 I have trouble finding the words to express my grief 
15554 It 's a tragedy for everyone 
15555 We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg some of them could have been on the plane said Johan Sletten 52 
15556 Sletten a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter 
15557 Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter 
15558 I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane she said 
15559 Just think of it a mining village where so many workers die 
15560 They must be having a tough time of it now 
15561 Barentsburg just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away 
15562 Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed 
15563 They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport 
15564 Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up 
15565 At this time of year the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses 
15566 Everything else is muddy the waters of the fjord leaden 
15567 Winter is in the air 
15568 Barentsburg is an even grimmer place a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia 
15569 Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles 800 km off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet 
15570 Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months 
15571 The terrain is mountainous the only roads are dirt tracks 
15572 Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there 
15573 Only Russia has chosen to do so 
15574 Ericsson says wins 1.2 bln SKR China order 
15575 STOCKHOLM 1996-08-30 
15576 Swedish telecoms group LM Ericsson AB said on Friday it won an order worth 1.2 billion crowns for a fixed public telecoms network in the Guangdong province of China 
15577 Ericsson said in a statement the order was from the Guangdong Post and Telecommunications Administration GPTA 
15578 The order included AXE switching equipment ISDN equipment Intelligent Network IN products broad-band multi-media communication network products services and training Ericsson spokesman Per Zetterquist told Reuters

15583 Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Friday that the territory had the infrastructural hardware to make a success of its future under Chinese sovereignty from mid-1997 
15584 We have the largest and most efficient port on the South China coast ; we have the best transport and telecommunications infrastructure in the world ; and we are investing in this hardware on an enormous scale Tsang said in a speech to Auckland during a visit to New Zealand 
15585 Hong Kong also had the necessary constitutional infrastructure in place with the promise of autonomy in running its affairs after the handover from Britain to China 
15586 What this means in practice is that Hong Kong will go on raising its own taxes issuing its own currency setting its own expenditure priorities and managing its own enormous financial reserves Tsang said 
15587 He acknowledged that many Hong Kong people had decided to seek their future elsewhere and others were sure to follow in the next nine months 
15588 But for the great majority of us Hong Kong is our home and Hong Kong 's future is our future

15645 In Jerusalem Israeli security forces were bracing for thousands of Palestinians expected to answer Arafat 's call earlier this week to come to the city holy to Moslems Arabs and Jews to pray in protest against Israel 's settlement policy in the West Bank and delay in peace negotiations

15654 They asked me to call in the Israeli charge d'affaires and discuss the matter with him he added 
15655 The Palestinian letter from Marwan Jilani said the destruction of the Jerusalem centre was an effort by Israel to alter the character demographic composition and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem and violated agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation 
15656 This most recent measure represents a revival of old malicious plans to confiscate the land and build units for Israeli settlers within the walls of the Old City 
15657 We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position based on international law and in accordance with U.N. resolutions against all such Israeli violations and illegal practices he said 
15658 On Tuesday Israeli crews hoisted a bulldozer over the walls of Jerusalem 's old city and demolished the centre saying it was being restored without a building permit 
15659 Canada had recently donated $ 30 million to the centre called the Burj al-Laqlaq Society 
15660 SOCCER REAL SCRAPE 1-1 DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH 
15661 LA CORUNA Spain 1996-08-31 
15662 A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday 
15663 The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna 
15664 Deportivo started strongly taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato 
15665 Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes 
15666 But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time 
15667 Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo keeper Jacques Songo'o 
15668 In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends and Donato who had earlier been booked was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick 
15669 Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of Europe 
15670 In the event coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport

15682 The Republic of Ireland 's new-look side dispelled painful memories of their last visit to Liechtenstein by beating the Alpine part-timers 5-0 in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday 
15683 The Irish under new manager Mick McCarthy took a 4-0 lead within 20 minutes through captain Andy Townsend 20-year-old Norwich striker Keith O'Neill Sunderland forward Niall Quinn and teenager Ian Harte 
15684 Quinn added his second and Ireland 's fifth just after the hour to complete the rout and give the Irish their biggest-ever away win 
15685 The result helped erase memories of Ireland 's visit to the Eschen stadium 14 months ago when Jack Charlton 's side were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw which ultimately cost them a place in the European championship finals

15838 BASEBALL GONZALEZ HOMERS TWICE AS RANGERS BEAT INDIANS 
15839 ARLINGTON Texas 1996-08-31 
15840 Juan Gonzalez homered twice and Ivan Rodriguez added a two-run shot as the Texas Rangers defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 in a matchup of division leaders Friday 
15841 Rodriguez 's 18th homer off Chad Ogea 7-5 in the first gave Texas a 2-0 lead 
15842 One out later Gonzalez smacked his 40th homer extending his hitting streak to 20 games 
15843 Gonzalez who hit in 21 straight games earlier this season joined Mickey Rivers as the only players in Texas history with two 20-game streaks in the same year 
15844 Gonzalez hit his second homer in the third for his fifth multi-homer game of the season 
15845 Gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 RBI broke Ruben Sierra 's team record of 119 set in 1989 
15846 The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped 
15847 It 's not something I 'm going to try to explain said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season 
15848 We 've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season 
15849 Roger Pavlik 15-7 gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings and became the fourth 15-game winner in the American League 
15850 Jeff Russell pitched two perfect innings for his third save 
15851 Brian Giles and Jim Thome homered for Cleveland 
15852 Cleveland 's lead over the White Sox in the American League Central dropped to nine games 
15853 Texas 's lead over Seattle in the West increased to six 
15854 At California Tino Martinez 's two-run homer keyed a three-run first and Andy Pettitte became the league 's first 19-game winner as the New York Yankees beat the Angels 6-2 
15855 New York snapped a season-high five-game losing streak and also got homers from Mariano Duncan Darryl Strawberry and Jim Leyritz 
15856 Pettite 19-7 allowed two runs and eight hits over eight innings with a walk and seven strikeouts 
15857 He improved to 12-2 following Yankees losses 
15858 Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth striking out two 
15859 Ex-Yankee Randy Velarde hit his 11th homer his most at any professional level 
15860 In Seattle Pete Incaviglia 's grand slam with one out in the sixth snapped a tie and lifted the Baltimore Orioles past the Seattle Mariners 5-2 
15861 It was Incaviglia 's sixth grand slam and 200th homer of his career 
15862 Baltimore 's Eddie Murray cracked his 20th homer of the season and 499th of his career 
15863 Jay Buhner hit his 38th homer and Edgar Martinez his 23rd for Seattle 
15864 The Orioles remained tied with the White Sox for the American League wild card with the Mariners a game back 
15865 In Toronto Kevin Tapani 12-8 allowed two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and Frank Thomas hit his 29th homer and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox cruised to an 11-2 victory over the Blue Jays 
15866 Thomas Harold Baines and Robin Ventura each collected three hits 
15867 Baines homered and scored three runs 
15868 Danny Tartabull added two hits and three RBI as all Chicago starters got at least one hit 
15869 In Oakland Dave Telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and Mark McGwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the Athetlics blanked the Boston Red Sox 7-0 
15870 Telgheder 2-5 snapped a personal three-game losing streak 
15871 Buddy Groom pitched a perfect ninth inning 
15872 McGwire singled home a run to spark a three-run sixth and capped the scoring with a two-run homer in the seventh 
15873 The loss was Boston 's seventh in its last 29 games 
15874 In Detroit Todd Van Poppel pitched a five-hitter for his first career shutout and Tony Clark homered to cap a four-run first inning as the Tigers blanked the Kansas City Royals 4-0 
15875 Van Poppel 3-6 walked two and struck out two in defeating the Royals for the second time this week 
15876 He threw 108 pitches as he lowered his ERA from 8.08 to 7.24 
15877 Kansas City has scored only one run in two games 
15878 In Milwaukee Marc Newfield homered off Jose Parra 5-4 leading off the bottom of the 12th as the Brewers rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins 
15879 Milwaukee has won 10 of its last 15 
15880 Bob Wickman 6-1 pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win his second for the Brewers 
15881 Matt Lawton hit a three-run homer off closer Mike Fetters with one out in the ninth to give Minnesota a 4-2 lead 
15882 But Milwaukee tied it up in the bottom of the ninth on pinch-hitter Dave Nilsson 's two-run double 
15883 CRICKET ESSEX AND KENT MADE TO SWEAT IN TITLE RACE 
15884 LONDON 1996-08-31 
15885 Essex and Kent both face tense finishes on Monday as they attempt to keep pace with title hopefuls Derbyshire and Surrey convincing three-day victors on Saturday in the English county championship run-in 
15886 Essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat Yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from Richard Kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose 
15887 Kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling Nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at Tunbridge Wells 
15888 Derbyshire nine-wicket winners over Worcestershire and Surrey who thrashed Warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs can instead take the day off along with rivals Leicestershire who beat Somerset inside two days 
15889 Warwickshire captain Tim Munton is tipping Surrey to emerge on top impressed by the positive influence of Australian coach Dave Gilbert but Derbyshire 's Australian captain Dean Jones is conceding nothing as his side chase their first title for 60 years 
15890 We took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive 
15891 Our catching will win or lose us the championship he said

15952 Lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his multi-national Saracens side to a 25-23 home win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club 
15953 French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh although the home team scored only one try through England scrum-half Kyran Bracken 
15954 The new French connection at Harlequins also made a good start Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech scoring a try apiece in their side 's 75-19 victory over Gloucester 
15955 Former England captain Will Carling handed the kicking duties finished with 20 points 
15956 With the first day of the league season briefly shifting the spotlight away from the discord between the clubs and the Rugby Football Union there were also emphatic victories for champions Bath 56-13 winners over Orrell and Northampton and narrow successes for Wasps and Bristol

16179 RUGBY UNION SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL 
16180 Andy Colquhoun 
16181 JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 
16182 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday 
16183 They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests 
16184 It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil 
16185 Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes 
16186 Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties 
16187 The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points 
16188 But they generally endured an off-day highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal 
16189 Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap 
16190 Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous 
16191 Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts 
16192 Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback 
16193 Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks second try 
16194 A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter 
16195 When the All Blacks did break through it was too late 
16196 Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation

16321 SQUASH HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT 
16322 HONG KONG 1996-08-31 
16323 Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday 
16324 The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third 
16325 When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player Hill shrieked at the Pakistani You cheat 
16326 He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat said Hill whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour 
16327 He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that 
16328 Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision 
16329 The Australian had upset Jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 
16330 I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled he added 
16331 He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end 
16332 I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it that 's Jansher 
16333 Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat 
16334 What he did was bad for squash bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors 
16335 We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that 
16336 I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly 
16337 I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action 
16338 Jansher bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final 
16339 Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 
16340 Eyles who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993 said that he would like to win for the good of the game 
16341 I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him said Eyles 
16342 My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration 
16343 I want to beat him so badly that I just cannot get it together

16347 GOLF PARNEVIK TAKES ONE-SHOT LEAD AT GREATER MILWAUKEE OPEN 
16348 MILWAUKEE Wisconsin 1996-08-31 
16349 Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open 
16350 Parnevik who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament 
16351 Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft 
16352 Nolan Henke who led by two strokes entering the third round carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 
16353 He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic 
16354 Tiger Woods who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament 
16355 The 20-year-old Woods who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship struggled on the front nine bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four 359-yard ninth hole 
16356 After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 
16357 After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes 
16358 Parnevik continued to storm through the course birdying three holes on the back nine including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes 
16359 I ca n't remember when I 've putted this well said Parnevik 
16360 I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in 
16361 My game feels very good 
16362 I 've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight 
16363 Whenever everyone 's making birdies you never want to be even par 
16364 Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole 
16365 I did n't hit it very well today said Henke 
16366 Jasper blew right by me 
16367 Once he did I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up 
16368 I made some really good pars 
16369 I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon 
16370 Right now I ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong 
16371 Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under 
16372 Steve Stricker who tied for second at last week 's World Series of Golf and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under 
16373 Duffy Waldorf who also tied for second at the World Series of Golf carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under including Kraft 
16374 The top four on the PGA Tour money list all skipped the tournament 
16375 TENNIS SPAIN U.S. TEAMS OPEN ON ROAD FOR 1997 FED CUP 
16376 Richard Finn 
16377 NEW YORK 1996-08-31 
16378 This year 's Fed Cup finalists defending champion Spain and the United States will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. Open 
16379 Spain travels to Belgium while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March 1-2 
16380 The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan 
16381 The semifinals are July 19-20 and the final September 27- 28 
16382 Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September 28-29 in Atlantic City 
16383 Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw 
16384 That is our sole goal 
16385 The United States edged Austria in Salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in April and then blanked Japan 5-0 in Nagoya last month in the semifinals 
16386 The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1994 
16387 Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again 
16388 I told Monica we need her if we want to win King said 
16389 Seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match 
16390 Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open 
16391 We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries said King 
16392 What we like would be Seles Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez 
16393 If she can get that threesome together King will feel good about her chances against the Spain 's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez 
16394 To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses said King

16501 BASEBALL KEVIN BROWN LOWERS ERA AS MARLINS BEAT REDS 
16502 CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 
16503 Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White 's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday 
16504 Brown 14-10 tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92 
16505 He struck out eight and did not walk a batter 
16506 Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season 
16507 Bolesy Florida manager John Boles told me yesterday You have to go nine tomorrow Brown said 
16508 In the early innings I was struggling I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch 
16509 I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh eighth or ninth 
16510 I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings 
16511 He has a devastating sinker observed Reds manager Ray Knight 
16512 The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league 
16513 I remember Nolan Ryan saying in 91 or 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman when they were starting 
16514 In Philadelphia Delino DeShields 's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett 2-3 scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies 
16515 Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games 
16516 Darren Dreifort 1-1 picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings 
16517 Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save 
16518 The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall and nine of 11 at home 
16519 Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles 
16520 In Chicago the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader 
16521 In the first game Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster 6-2 outdueled Atlanta 's Tom Glavine 13-8 for his third straight win 3-2 
16522 Foster a .333 hitter helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single 
16523 The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory 
16524 Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago 's four errors 
16525 Mike Mordecai singled doubled and homered for Atlanta which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors 84-50 
16526 In Montreal Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win 
16527 Sanders 8-4 struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight 
16528 He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second and won for the seventh time in eight decisions 
16529 The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh 
16530 Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth 
16531 Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games 
16532 In New York Marvin Benard 's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4 
16533 Benard hitting .467 14-for-30 against the Mets this season hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch 8-10 in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2 
16534 Estes 3-4 was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth 
16535 Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza who collected a career-high four RBI but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save 
16536 The loss was the Mets eighth straight their longest slide since September 1993 and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine 
16537 In St Louis Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4 
16538 Benes 12-8 allowed three runs walked three and struck out three for the win 
16539 St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season 
16540 Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals who won for just the third time in 11 games 
16541 Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies 
16542 In Pittsburgh Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0 
16543 It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game 
16544 Wall 9-4 struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win 
16545 TENNIS EDBERG REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY 
16546 Richard Finn 
16547 NEW YORK 1996-08-30 
16548 Refusing to go quietly in the night Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher trailing and hurting quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday 
16549 The 30-year-old Edberg a former two-time Open champion had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German hampered by a left hamstring injury decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre 
16550 A win is a win 
16551 I 'll take it Edberg who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory 
16552 Ironically Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl 's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match 
16553 After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on 
16554 I knew he had problems with something Edberg said 
16555 I really was n't surprised 
16556 Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him 
16557 I did n't really feel good to begin with I had problems finding the timing on the ball seeing the ball said Edberg who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round 
16558 This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard 
16559 I had to fight hard 
16560 Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set 
16561 Edberg lost his own serve twice but he rallied for three breaks of his own the last to wrap up the set 
16562 That 's where the match sort of changed said Edberg 
16563 I think once I got that second set I felt a lot better about my game 
16564 Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer 
16565 It does n't look all that bad Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis 
16566 However the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final 
16567 I 'm always being realistic said Edberg 
16568 Like I said many times I think it 's a very little chance but nothing is impossible 
16569 If I play great tennis that could take me a long way 
16570 A lot of things can happen like tonight 
16571 BOXING PRINCE NASEEM RETAINS WBO FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE 
16572 DUBLIN 1996-08-31 
16573 Britain 's Naseem Hamed retained his WBO featherweight title on Saturday when Mexico 's Manuel Medina was retired by his corner at the end of the 11th round 
16574 SOCCER AUSTRIA DOMINATE SCOTLAND IN WORLD CUP QUALIFIER 
16575 Steve Pagani 
16576 VIENNA 1996-08-31 
16577 Austria dominated their World Cup group four qualifier against Scotland on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors defence and had to settle for a goalless draw 
16578 Scotland who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match were unable to repeat their performance 
16579 Austria 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post 
16580 They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide 
16581 Everton 's Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save 
16582 Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee 's decision 
16583 The result is acceptable Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters 
16584 We 'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good 
16585 SK Rapid 's Dietmar Kuehbauer who gave an impressive performance said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes 
16586 Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch 
16587 We have lost two points 
16588 The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won he said

16597 PARIS 1996-08-31 
16598 Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday 
16599 The victory extended to 29 matches France 's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf 
16600 Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back 
16601 Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions 
16602 After a sterile first half France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine Zidane 
16603 This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo 
16604 Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez 
16605 Jacquet beginning the 22-month countdown to France 's hosting of the World Cup finals said We have an identity as a team which we are going to work on

16616 BRUSSELS 1996-08-31 
16617 Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break 
16618 Turkish fans upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence 
16619 Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order 
16620 The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde 
16621 But Yalcin who had come on just four minutes earlier turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray 
16622 Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area 
16623 Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval Turkey 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over 
16624 The visitors seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts 
16625 With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal 
16626 But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball 
16627 Belgium 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten

16710 Paper says Thatcher 's office consulted astrologer 
16711 LONDON 1996-09-01 
16712 A British newspaper said Margaret Thatcher was so shaken by an IRA attempt on her life when she was prime minister in 1984 that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats 
16713 The Sunday Telegraph quoted Majorie Orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher a Libran after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative Party conference more than a decade ago 
16714 Orr said Thatcher 's press secretary Bernard Ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future 
16715 Bernard Ingham told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know Orr said 
16716 Orr said she never had to telephone 
16717 She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves 
16718 Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was a load of rubbish and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher 's stars 
16719 Thatcher dubbed the Iron Lady for her driven forceful personality was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry 
16720 Former U.S. president Ronald Reagan 's wife Nancy admitted in her biography My Turn that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband 's schedule

16772 Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election which must be held by May 1997

16827 S. African Afrikaners still seek own territory 
16828 CAPE TOWN 1996-08-31 
16829 South African right-wing Afrikaners on Saturday revived their campaign for a form of self-rule identifying a sparsely-populated area in Northern Cape province as the best place for a home of their own 
16830 Constand Viljoen leader of the Freedom Front party told a news conference in Pretoria self-determination for Afrikaners could begin at local government level 
16831 Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level towards the sub-regions he said 
16832 We think that the Afrikaner model within this new multi- ethnic society of South Africa will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard 
16833 Viljoen broke with other right-wing whites in 1994 by taking part in the country 's first all-race elections in April of that year saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with President Nelson Mandela 's majority African National Congress 
16834 Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections saying the alternative was war 
16835 Their threats came to nothing 
16836 Viljoen has hailed clauses in South Africa 's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the Afrikaners descendants of the country 's Dutch German and French settlers 
16837 According to state television Viljoen told the news conference the self-rule model should be introduced in parts of the Northern Cape provinces where a majority of people whites and mixed-race Coloureds speak Afrikaans 
16838 Rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census 
16839 NAIROBI 1996-08-31 
16840 A Rwandan refugee lobby group called on Saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern Zaire during a census from Sunday to be conducted by aid workers 
16841 The Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda RDR urged the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any policing approach and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation 
16842 The RDR appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest the group said in a statement 
16843 It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by Rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into Rwanda 
16844 U.N. officials said more than 1,000 aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated 727,000 refugees in camps around the eastern Zairean border town of Goma 
16845 Only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to Rwanda in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly 
16846 Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said at the end of a visit to Rwanda last week that the Zairean and Rwandan governments agreed on an organised massive and unconditional repatriation of the 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in Zaire 
16847 He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous starting with the closure of refugee camps 
16848 RDR said it feared forced expulsions would start in days 
16849 Zairean troops expelled 15,000 refugees in August last year 
16850 Many of the 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees in Zaire and nearly 600,000 in Tanzania refuse to go home saying they fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda of up to a million people by Hutus

16856 Marriner said that NATO troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between Tuzla and Mahala to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village 
16857 Mahala is a Moslem village on Bosnian Serb republic territory 
16858 Moslems were driven from the village during the 43- month Bosnian war and most of their houses were destroyed 
16859 Some Moslems began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week 
16860 Fights and shooting broke out between the Moslems and Serb police on Thursday and NATO troops finally brought restored order 
16861 A Reuters reporter who entered Mahala on Saturday morning found it tranquil but NATO troops and U.N. police were seen on the ground and NATO helicopters flew overhead 
16862 Chechens exuberant but cautious on peace deal 
16863 Liutauras Stremaitis 
16864 URUS-MARTAN Russia 1996-08-31 
16865 Crowds of pro-independence Chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty 
16866 More than a thousand women children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km 12 miles away 
16867 The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced 
16868 Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev who declared independence in 1991 and children carrying photographs of him called Troops out ! 
16869 Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists 
16870 It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region 
16871 But the people in the crowd on Saturday who had turned out in support of the rebels did not seem sure that the war was over 
16872 We hope for the best that it really has ended so we can live in peace 
16873 It 's our only dream said a 30-year-old woman Mubatik Dagayeva 
16874 Aiza Dudayeva with her 10-year-old son beside her shared the guarded optimism 
16875 We really want the war to end we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win said Dudayeva adding that she was from Urus-Martan 
16876 Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev who has been sidelined in the peace deal has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave 
16877 But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists 
16878 Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars firing their guns in the air as the crowd rushed towards them 
16879 Mouldi Mamatuyev in his late 20 's dressed in black and carrying a machine gun was welcomed by his mother and sister 
16880 Two sons have come back said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva 
16881 It 's the end 
16882 We believe in God 
16883 Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry Allahu Akhbar God is Greatest and Freedom for Chechnya ! 
16884 The fighter sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace 
16885 The war has ended if everything works out if there is law there will be power 
16886 Only Sheriat Islamic law can end the war 
16887 Polish group to bid for Ruch newsstand chain paper 
16888 WARSAW 1996-08-31 
16889 A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA BRE plans to rival France 's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday 
16890 Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher mineral water firm Multico and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million with finance provided by BRE 
16891 The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch 's shares the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange 
16892 This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying without giving a name 
16893 A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September the daily said 
16894 News-stand chain Ruch which controls about 65 percent of Poland 's press distribution market had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995 
16895 It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism 
16896 Zycie Warszawy said the new open consortium which also included several listed Polish firms would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans 
16897 It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets 
16898 Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity 
16899 Two consortia UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms placed initial bids 
16900 But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette 
16901 Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled

16918 The stories have been given to me by people

16929 Mexican army attacked in Michoacan state report 
16930 MEXICO CITY 1996-08-30 
16931 A group of heavily-armed men attacked a military convoy in the western Mexican state of Michoacan on Friday killing one soldier and wounding two radio reports said 
16932 Radio Red quoted local police in the town of Tacambaro Michoacan 80 km 50 miles south of the state capital Morelia as saying 40 to 50 armed men attacked the convoy 
16933 Gonzalo Montoya a police commander in Tacambaro told Radio Red the group was armed with AK-47s and other high-powered assault rifles and wore military-style fatigues 
16934 Montoya said he thought the attackers were criminals linked to drug trafficking or kidnapping in the area 
16935 We often see people dressed in military-style clothing here he said 
16936 The attack comes a day after rebels of the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army EPR launched coordinated attacks in at least three Mexican states killing up to 14 people and wounding about 20 
16937 China said to fear dissidents more than criminals 
16938 MANILA 1996-08-31 
16939 The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership a human rights activist said on Saturday 
16940 Xiao Qiang executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national Strike Hard campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death 
16941 Although supposedly aimed at criminals dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party 's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death Xiao said in an interview 
16942 China is going through this power transition period 
16943 The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent said Xiao in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China 
16944 He said one of Wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption 
16945 Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price 
16946 Those issues are not going to go away by repression 
16947 You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive he said 
16948 Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class a euphemism for coercive ideological reform 
16949 Wang 45 was sentenced last month to one year 's re-education by labour but was released because of ill-health 
16950 Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide 
16951 Police beat Wang and his colleague Chen Longde and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well Xiao said 
16952 Manila hails Indonesia OIC for peace deal support

16961 Burma 's Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law 
16962 Deborah Charles 
16963 RANGOON 1996-08-31 
16964 Burma 's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement 
16965 The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home 
16966 Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May and about 30 of them had been sentenced most to long prison terms 
16967 In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy NLD ahead of a party congress 
16968 Most were released but several dozen remain in custody 
16969 The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown including Suu Kyi 's assistant Win Htein 
16970 The military government which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state 
16971 But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials 
16972 When our people are tried they are tried in a very secretive way 
16973 Their families are not told she said 
16974 Suu Kyi who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma 's government was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 
16975 Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms 
16976 The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council SLORC which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations never recognised the poll 
16977 This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play she said 
16978 They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial 
16979 Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison 
16980 Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail she said 
16981 Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years 
16982 Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon 's Insein Prison 
16983 Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse 
16984 If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence Suu Kyi said 
16985 Hla Than an elected member of parliament for the NLD died in early August after being at Insein for six years 
16986 His death came five weeks after James Leander Leo Nichols a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul died while serving a prison term at Insein 
16987 Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement 
16988 But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself 
16989 We will carry on 
16990 Nobody is free from arrest in Burma

17018 The group demanded Wang 's release and said his detention was a dangerous signal China was returning to its Cultural Revolution days 
17019 Last month Wang 45 a veteran dissident of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement was ordered to serve one year of re-education through labour but released because of poor health 
17020 Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts 
17021 Wang was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 1989 with heavy loss of life 
17022 Chinese authorities appeared to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to go through a more complicated judicial process to impose criminal sentences Western diplomats have said

17112 DETROIT 1996-08-31 
17113 Automakers suppliers insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks 
17114 Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts 
17115 Since 1993 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour 
17116 The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend including Interstate 95 on the East Coast Interstates 80 and 90 in the Midwest and Interstate 5 in California 
17117 The boards read Air Bag Safety Everyone Buckled Kids in Back 
17118 Janet Dewey executive director of the industry-funded National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts 
17119 A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat she said 
17120 The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing smart air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly 
17121 Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized unbelted adult male not a small child 
17122 Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries 
17123 Even if changes are made to airbags today we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology Dewey said 
17124 The public has n't been getting the message

17145 More than 300 U.S. warplanes and 20 ships were available on Saturday in case President Bill Clinton ordered the use of U.S. force against Iraqi military action in northern Iraq U.S. defense officials said 
17146 They said 200 fighter planes including 79 on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson were already in the Gulf ; the aircraft carrier Enterprise was in the eastern Mediterranean with 79 more and an air expeditionary force with up to 40 more was ready to fly from the United States if ordered 
17147 Yesterday the president ordered the Department of Defense to take prudent planning steps to have forces ready to deploy to the region should he direct us to do so Pentagon spokesman Doug Kennett said 
17148 We have taken those prudent planning steps 
17149 Clinton said on Saturday he had ordered U.S. forces in the Gulf to go on high alert and was reinforcing them in response to Iraqi attacks on Kurdish dissidents in northern Iraq 
17150 These developments cause me grave concern Clinton said at a campaign stop in Troy Tennessee 
17151 But he added It is premature at this time and I want to emphasize that highly premature to speculate on any response we might have 
17152 The U.S. defense officials said military flights to enforce no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq doubled over the weekend

17157 The expeditionary force would include nearly 1,000 Air Force personnel in ground and support crews they said 
17158 The 23,000 U.S. military people already in the Gulf consist of 15,000 sailors and Marines 6,000 U.S. servicemen based primarily in Saudi Arabia and 2,000 U.S. troops in the area for military exercises

17225 Controversial IRA film screened at Venice festival 
17226 Vera Haller 
17227 VENICE Italy 1996-08-31 
17228 Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over Michael Collins his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival 
17229 The film starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts recounts the life of Michael Collins the Irish Republican Army 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921 
17230 Although not due for release in Britain until early next year some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland 
17231 Jordan defends his decision to make the film whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research saying it was more about history than any political statement 
17232 The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros 
17233 How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ? 
17234 Very rarely 
17235 Jordan whose 1992 film The Crying Game also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA said Collins was more than just a revolutionary 
17236 He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel Jordan said 
17237 Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today 
17238 He was a soldier and a statesman and over time a man of peace 
17239 Leeson the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in Schindler 's List plays the lead role in Jordan 's film 
17240 Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland Collins best friend and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan played by Roberts 
17241 Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras 
17242 A set however was used for the fighting scenes 
17243 Noting that information about Collins was as mysterious as the existence he maintained Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film 
17244 I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches he said 
17245 I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have 
17246 It is a very true film 
17247 One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain in an ambush in 1922 
17248 I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over Michael Collins but I 'll never make a more important one Jordan said 
17249 In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today
