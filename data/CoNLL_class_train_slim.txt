1834<O>officials keen to cut capital flight will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum a customs official said on Friday <MISC>Russian 
1835<O>We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from deputy head of the currency department at the told <ORG>State Customs Committee Reuters <PER>Marina Volkova <LOC>Russia 
1836<O>said last year goods had been exported under many barter deals with nothing imported in return <PER>Volkova <MISC>Russian 
1837<O>She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 
1838<O>Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year or about eight percent of all exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion she said <MISC>Russian 
1839<O>The cost of exported goods is too often understated so the actual share of barter deals in exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher said <PER>Volkova <MISC>Russian 
1840<O>A few days ago President issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals and said this could substantially improve the situation <PER>Boris Yeltsin Volkova <MISC>Russian 
1841<O>In line with the decree which will come into force on November 1 all barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days <MISC>Russian 
1842<O>If traders are late they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods said <PER>Volkova 
1843<O>Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers but said the authorities are currently tackling the technicalities of the issue <PER>Volkova 
1844<O>Barter has always been a feature of the 's foreign trade but 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus <PER>Yeltsin <LOC>Soviet Union 
1845<O>A few years ago barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of exports because thousands of trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable banks and money transfer systems said <PER>Volkova <MISC>Russian Russian 
1846<O>Now many banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones <MISC>Russian

3267<O>copper stocks owned by state reserve trade <LOC>China 
3268<PER>Lynne O'Donnell 
3269<O>1996-08-23 <LOC>HONG KONG 
3270<O>Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in bonded warehouses confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate probably belongs to 's strategic state reserve industry sources said on Friday <LOC>Shanghai China 
3271<O>Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of where some of the strategic stockpile was stored they said <LOC>Yingkou 
3272<O>Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into by the in June and July <ORG>China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp CNIEC <LOC>Shanghai 
3273<O>It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve administered directly by the central government 's owned the copper <ORG>State Planning Commission 
3274<O>Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise 
3275<O>But one source the head of a trading house said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not <LOC>Hong Kong 
3276<O>If they spend all this money moving the copper to it will be sitting there for years he said <LOC>Yingkou 
3277<O>Once it arrives in it is subject to monitoring by the which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders he said <ORG>State Planning Commission <LOC>Yingkou 
3278<O>Mystery has surrounded the stockpile in recent months with traders unsure not only of who owns it but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it <LOC>Shanghai 
3279<O>Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the <ORG>London Metal Exchange LME 
3280<O>A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price 
3281<O>lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously <ORG>CNIEC LME 
3282<O>Traders in said could well have lent it to the market at around 2,700 a tonne and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year <ORG>CNIEC <MISC>US$ <LOC>Asia 
3283<O>This would have cleared a healthy profit which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs <ORG>CNIEC 
3284<O>Word that had offered the copper to trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market <ORG>CNIEC <MISC>European 
3285<O>Industry analysts said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes whoever they are is the most important short-term fundamental in an already tight world market <ORG>Bloomsbury Minerals Economics BME 
3286<O>repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by with said to be helping the trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals <ORG>BME Sumitomo Corp CNIEC <MISC>Japanese 
3287<O>and have made no comments on the talk and traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement <ORG>Sumitomo CNIEC <MISC>Chinese 
3288<O>Traders in said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the bonded warehouses <LOC>Shanghai Shanghai 
3289<O>They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases 
3290<O>They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market 
3291<O>But these concerns were irrelevant a trader said despite a forecast that domestic copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year <MISC>Chinese <LOC>Singapore 
3292<O>As with many commodities there is a desire by the government to keep a stockpile of the metal he said <MISC>Chinese

6077<O>1996-08-23 <LOC>NEW YORK 
6078<O>Corporate is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years according to a recent study <LOC>America 
6079<O>What it comes down to is this If you 're highly skilled you 'll benefit nicely 
6080<O>But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals you 'll be paid less 
6081<O>The survey conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line rather than how well an employee performs a specific task <ORG>Towers Perrin 
6082<O>Presently for example if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks he or she can expect a certain salary said a principal <ORG>Towers Perrin <PER>Sandra O'Neal 
6083<O>In the future the accountant will be evaluated solely on knowledge skill and abilities she said 
6084<O>In addition to using accounting skills the accountant will also have to be creative work well in a team be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals 
6085<O>The good news is if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities you 'll be paid more said <PER>O'Neal 
6086<O>The bad news is if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team to customer service and the organisation 's goals you 'll be paid less 
6087<O>Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result 
6088<O>Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure and 78 percent report that they are considering a new skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees 
6089<O>This coming shift said is not just isolated or a fad <PER>O'Neal 
6090<O>It 's an inexorable change 
6091<O>After corporations adopted a military model creating hierarchical organisations where the concept of defined tasks worked great she said <MISC>World War II 
6092<O>But as the economy became global customers were more demanding and problems became more complex 
6093<O>Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers said <PER>O'Neal 
6094<O>Now organisations must change to stay competitive 
6095<O>says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises <PER>O'Neal 
6096<O>If your team does well you 'll do well 
6097<O>If it does n't do well do n't expect a raise 
6098<O>Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? 
6099<O>That 's an important question we used to ask a lot said <PER>O'Neal 
6100<O>It 's not a question we ask any more 
6101<O>The more important question is Do we have results ? 
6102<O>To get those results 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives such as employee and team award programmes and education 
6103<O>Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well said <PER>O'Neal 
6104<O>For example the survey rated some participants in the survey as high-performing companies based on their return on equity above 16 percent 
6105<O>Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success 
6106<O>They respect employees more they trust employees more and they value their employees more said <PER>O'Neal 
6107<O>The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership
