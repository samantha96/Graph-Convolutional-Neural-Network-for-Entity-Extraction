4 Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday 
5 But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan 
6 China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net 
7 Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area 
8 The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time 
9 Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders 
10 Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria 
11 Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net 
12 It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes 
13 Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal 
14 Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute 
15 Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence 
16 Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did 
17 Japan coach Shu Kamo said The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us 
18 The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us 
19 Japan co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA are favourites to regain their title here

22 RUGBY UNION CUTTITTA BACK FOR ITALY AFTER A YEAR 
23 ROME 1996-12-06 
24 Italy recalled Marcello Cuttitta 
25 on Friday for their friendly against Scotland at Murrayfield more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection 
26 Cuttitta who trainer George Coste said was certain to play on Saturday week was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England at Twickenham last month 
27 Stefano Bordon is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado Covi who had been recalled for the England game after five years out of the national team 
28 Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages 
29 Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback 
30 He ended the World Cup on the wrong note Coste said 
31 I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available 
32 I think now is the right time for him to return

34 SOCCER LATE GOALS GIVE JAPAN WIN OVER SYRIA 
35 AL-AIN United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 
36 Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday 
37 Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body 
38 It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes 
39 Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal 
40 Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute 
41 Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa 's goal 
42 Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute 
43 A minute later Bitar produced a good double save first from Kazuyoshi Miura 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot 
44 Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute parrying away his header from a corner 
45 Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma 's low drive in the 53rd minute

146 FIFA 's players status committee meeting in Barcelona decided that although the Udinese document was basically valid it could not be legally protected 
147 The committee said the Italian club had violated regulations by failing to inform Feyenoord with whom the player was under contract

192 Centre Jason Little will miss Australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday 
193 Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert 
194 Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu 
195 The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours 
196 The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic 
197 Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town 
198 Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 said Andrew also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance 
199 On tour Australia have won all four tests against Italy Scotland Ireland and Wales and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game

218 League title-holders Steaua Bucharest who finished bottom of their Champions League group in the European Cup have only two players in the squad

232 CRICKET LARA ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY 
233 Robert Galvin 
234 MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 
235 Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday 
236 Lara disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour 
237 Australia who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series overhauled West Indies total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats 
238 All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd 
239 Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes 
240 His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law who scored 21 added 71 off 85 balls 
241 Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket 
242 West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday 
243 He Lara had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors dressing room 
244 The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle 
245 It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin 
246 Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out

298 CRICKET LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY 
299 MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 
300 West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour after already being disciplined for misconduct when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday 
301 Lara who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat 
302 The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket 
303 West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat 
304 Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him 
305 As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd 
306 On several occasions during his innings the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him 
307 Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday 
308 Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take 
309 Lara who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper 
310 Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings 
311 Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago 
312 Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected 
313 Pakistan who arrive next week are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament

795 SOCCER FIFA BOSS HAVELANGE STANDS BY WEAH 
796 ROME 1996-12-06 
797 FIFA chairman Joao Havelange said on Friday he would personally present AC Milan George Weah with world soccer 's fair play award despite the striker 's attack on Porto captain Jorge Costa 
798 In an interview with the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport he was quoted as saying Weah had been provoked into the assault which left Costa with a broken nose 
799 FIFA has named the Liberian for its 1996 Fair Play award and it is not going to change its decision Havelange said 
800 A reaction provoked cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition 
801 I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in Lisbon and I 'm confident that Costa himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand 
802 Weah was suspended for one match by UEFA European soccer 's governing body pending a fuller investigation 
803 The incident took place in the players tunnel after a European Champions League match on November 20 
804 Weah has admitted head butting Costa but said he reacted to racist taunts 
805 He has offered to apologise if Costa acknowledges the provocation 
806 Costa who needed surgery on his nose has not accepted the offer and was reported to be considering suing Weah 
807 Weah served out his suspension during Milan 's 2-1 home defeat by Rosenborg of Norway on Wednesday 
808 The defeat put the Italians out of the Europoean Cup

877 GUNMEN KILL FOUR IN S.AFRICA 'S ZULU PROVINCE 
878 DURBAN South Africa 1996-12-06 
879 At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in South Africa 's volatile Zulu heartland police said on Friday 
880 A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress ANC had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni on KwaZulu-Natal province 's south coast on Thursday night 
881 The victims were 18 and 20 he said adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting 
882 In another attack also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night two men were shot dead near Umkomaas 
883 We suspect that these killings are linked to politics spokesman Bala Naidoo told Reuters 
884 There had been no arrests 
885 The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZulu-Natal and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots 
886 They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores flock back to their home villages 
887 More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the ANC and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party in the province

890 PRAGUE 1996-12-06 
891 Czech President Vaclav Havel on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine Albright who is of Czech extraction as the United States first woman Secretary of State 
892 In a statement Havel who is recovering from cancer surgery said Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend a tested diplomat and a true American of fine origins 
893 I look forward to continuing our good relations 
894 with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State 
895 I wish her well Havel said in a statement to Reuters 
896 Havel who helped lead the velvet revolution that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989 invited Albright then working for a private foreign policy think tank to advise his new democratic government in 1990 
897 Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital 
898 Albright born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 
899 As an academic Albright studied and lectured on Europe 's 20th century problems before becoming U.S. ambassador to the United Nations 
900 Czech diplomats seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO praised the selection of Albright known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former Soveit-bloc countries 
901 The nomination 
902 is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters 
903 Albright is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures 
904 Czech ambassador to the United Nations Karel Kovanda told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright is a little light in our diplomatic heaven but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs

914 CZECH VICE-PM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS 
915 PRAGUE 1996-12-06 
916 Saturday 's national congress of the ruling Czech Civic Democratic Party ODS will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent Foreign Minister and ODS vice-chairman Josef Zieleniec said on Friday 
917 Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure having financing of the party be more transparent 
918 are absolutely fundamental Zieleniec who is also vice-premier in the government told Reuters 
919 He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority the ODS executive led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the Czech second city Brno 
920 I am convinced that the congress will tackle these proposals he said 
921 The ODS a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992 
922 Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country 's post-Communist economic reforms 
923 The party led by the vigorously-confident Klaus took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of Czech parliament 
924 But after the first round vote a week before the ODS had the potential to win as many 79 seats 
925 Klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated putting the centre-left Social Democrats in a strong second-place position

927 POLAND GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR SWISS ACCOUNTS 
928 Marcin Grajewski 
929 WARSAW 1996-12-06 
930 Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two 
931 Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati unveiling first findings of a special government commission said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts 
932 In 1970s Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs 
933 What was its right to the money ...I do not know Rosati told a news conference 
934 Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland 
935 Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews 
936 Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two 
937 I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided Rosati said 
938 Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports 
939 He said however that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called dead accounts as part of the compensation 
940 About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens whose data we do not precisely know 
941 The issue is of moral and legal nature because its financial significance is small Rosati said 
942 Under pressure from international Jewish organisations Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims 
943 The conservative Radical Democrats FDP have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs $ 31 million in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations 
944 But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work 
945 INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE 
946 Steven Silber 
947 WARSAW 1996-12-06 
948 Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share the firm 's chief executive said 
949 Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround 
950 So far this year Zywiec whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys 
951 It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres 
952 Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer 
953 The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption currently around 40 litres 
954 He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland with its 40-million population Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain 
955 Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors 
956 Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim 
957 Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd SAB bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers which together hold more than 20 percent of the market and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery Elbrewery Company Ltd. EB 
958 Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins 
959 He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share 
960 But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade largely in production would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic 
961 Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity 
962 I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers and I 'm speaking about all the brands and as we make good beers 
963 I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers he said 
964 Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one 
965 He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand Zywiec Full Light which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand 
966 You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands van Boxmeer said adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland 
967 Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made

969 HAVEL HAS TRAECHEOTOMY AFTER CONDITIONS WORSENS 
970 PRAGUE 1996-12-06 
971 Doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy to help Czech President Vaclav Havel breathe after cancer surgery on his lungs earlier this week a spokesman said on Friday 
972 He said that the procedure to insert a device into Havel 's throat done after his breathing worsened on Thursday had helped and the president 's condition significantly improved 
973 A worsening in the president 's lung functions took place yesterday presidential spokesman Ladlislav Spacek said in a statement 
974 A tracheotomy was performed and supportive breathing was installed through the help of a breathing device he said 
975 After these steps the president 's condition signigicantly improved 
976 Havel has been recovering from surgery on Monday which removed a small malignant tumour and half of his right lung 
977 Doctors after the operation said that they had caught the cancer early and that Havel could fully recover from the surgery within six weeks 
978 His spokesman said on Thursday that Havel 60 and a heavy smoker had also developed a slight case of pneumonia in the left lung

999 BELFAST 1996-12-06 
1000 A woman was charged on Friday with terrorist offences after three Irish Republican Army mortar bombs were found in a Belfast house police said

1003 She will appear in court on Saturday

1006 Britain sets conditions to clear American alliance 
1007 Edna Fernandes 
1008 LONDON 1996-12-06 
1009 The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions 
1010 Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic which would create greater competition on the routes 
1011 Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading which was asked to examine the case last month 
1012 I agree that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S. he said 
1013 His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed 
1014 Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared 
1015 The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport the busiest in Europe 
1016 American 's parent AMR Corp. said it did not view the terms as a deal breaker 
1017 However it called the conditions more severe than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances 
1018 British Airways 's initial response was that unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value 
1019 It added that it would be prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition 
1020 The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter 
1021 It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route 
1022 The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme

1024 Med oil products mostly lower as Elf strike ends 
1025 LONDON 1996-12-06 
1026 Mediterranean oil products were steady to mostly lower on Friday after Elf refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike 
1027 Gas oil erased Thursday 's gains plunging $ 5.50 a tonne in line with the screen 
1028 Volume was very thin and market remained long with premiums down $ 1 at about high cif quotes +$0.50 basis Genoa 
1029 The sharp moves on the screen make everyone nervous a trader said 
1030 Trades were discussed in 0.2 0.5 and one percent heating oil into Syria and Lebanon and there were fresh inquiries from France and Spain for low sulphur diesel 
1031 Interest remains focussed on a tender by India for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery 
1032 Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude but also suffered from some pricing pressure 
1033 High sulphur cracked fuel lost about $ 3 to $ 109-111 fob Med with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market 
1034 The chance of material heading north talked earlier this week may be in jeopardy now since American fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the U.S 
1035 Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find a new home and with the arbitrage from the U.S. to Europe open Rotterdam is a prime candidate 
1036 Low sulphur prices were lower with cif Med pegged in the mid to low $ 140s 
1037 Gasoline prices fell after striking Elf refinery workers voted to go back to work traders said 
1038 But an open arbitrage to the U.S. and tight Italian supplies after Elf scooped up Med material over the last week continued to underpin prices into next week 
1039 New meningitis scare hits Britain 
1040 LONDON 1996-12-06 
1041 A boy has died from meningitis and a girl from the same school has contracted the disease in the second such scare to hit Britain in as many weeks health authorities said on Friday 
1042 The 16-year-old who attended Sale Grammar School in the northern England city of Manchester died less than a day after becoming ill 
1043 The 15-year-old girl is also suffering from the disease and hospital officials described her condition as serious 
1044 At the moment there is no evidence the two cases are linked 
1045 However we are assuming they are as a precaution for the time being a spokeswoman said 
1046 The more than 1,260 students at the school are being given antibiotics as a precaution 
1047 Wales grappled with its own cluster of meningitis cases on a university campus in Cardiff 
1048 At least two people have died and hundreds have been vaccinated in an effort to contain the virus 
1049 In Scotland eight people have died and hundreds more are fighting a widespread food-poisoning outbreak 
1050 A health authority spokeswoman said 78 people suspected of having the disease including 64 confirmed cases were still being treated 
1051 Three were listed in poor condition 
1052 More than 290 people have reported symptoms in Lanarkshire county the worst-hit area since the outbreak first came to light after people ate tainted meat pies at a pensioners lunch

1060 Before Gorst 's statement Major had a one-seat majority in the 651-seat House of Commons lower house of parliament 
1061 In his formal statement Gorst said I am today withdrawing my cooperation from the government and shall not treat the whip as either a summons to attend the House of Commons or as placing me under any obligation to vote as advised 
1062 Gorst resigned over a hospital closure in his constituency

1135 NYC Jan refunding has its 1st Euro floating rate 
1136 NEW YORK 1996-12-06 
1137 New York City on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for European investors 
1138 A city official who declined to be named explained that Goldman Sachs which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering 
1139 By selling the floating rate debt the city hopes to establish a benchmark the city official said adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective 
1140 The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then 
1141 In November New York City said it became the first U.S. municipality to offer bonds for sale in European markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the London Stock Exchange 
1142 The refunding planned for January also includes a $ 475 million tax-exempt offering 
1143 No specific date in January has been selected for the debt sale the official added

1149 Wall St speculates about Santa Fe savior 
1150 Brendan Intindola 
1151 NEW YORK 1996-12-06 
1152 Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp 
1153 Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont announced Thursday 
1154 Wall Street since the bid has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a bear hug or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor 
1155 Newmont said the companies have had previous contact though declined to detail the encounters 
1156 Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder and that if a rival buyer is found Newmont may not be able to match its offer 
1157 They said the Santa Fe deal which includes desirable Nevada mining territory would only payoff for Newmont longer term 
1158 Newmont in fact will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years which also limits its capacity to raise its offer 
1159 Any deal friendly or hostile would almost assuredly be a stock swap which is necessary to preserve the tax-free pooling-of-interest accounting they said 
1160 Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit 
1161 Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's Nevada South America and Central Asia presence they said 
1162 A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list 
1163 Homestake based in San Francisco operates gold mines in the United States Australia Chile and Canada 
1164 Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share or $ 30.3 million on revenues of $ 746.3 million 
1165 Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share or $ 40 million on revenues of $ 350 million 
1166 Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada California Montana Canada Brazil Australia Chile Kazakstan Mexico and Ghana 
1167 PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion 
1168 I think Homestake could come in as a white knight but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number 
1169 One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent but there is going to be a Santa Fe deal with someone he said 
1170 Longer term two to three years out a Newmont-Santa Fe deal is positive it does all the right things 
1171 But in the near-term it is at worst neutral the analyst added 
1172 Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares 
1173 In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 
1174 Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe which is almost always a euphemism for We have more money in our pocket said an arb referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont 
1175 Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a a 32 cent bid because there is no formal tender offer only the proposal letter mailed to Santa Fe 's board

1186 Multinational commander going back to east Zaire 
1187 Jonathan Wright 
1188 NAIROBI 1996-12-06 
1189 The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside 
1190 Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km 40 miles west of the eastern city of Goma 
1191 If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire he said 
1192 Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground he said 
1193 General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home 
1194 The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area 
1195 Kinshasa opposes airdrops apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters 
1196 Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way 
1197 It does n't look as though they airdrops are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs non-governmental organisations are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda Young told reporters 
1198 But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information 
1199 We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access to the large group of refugees with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies 
1200 If they ca n't move because they are too weak then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means airdrops ...It 's complex it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary 
1201 If it is necessary I wo n't hesitate to use it he said 
1202 Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government he said It would have to be in the last resort 
1203 It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger 
1204 Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? 
1205 And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire 
1206 Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security 
1207 I know their the Zairean government 's position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also the general added 
1208 He denied that his contacts criticised by Kinshasa with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations 
1209 I do n't negotiate he said 
1210 I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do 
1211 When we do n't know where the front is we do n't know what the risk is 
1212 Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu 
1213 The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale 
1214 The general did not mention these refugees who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking 
1215 Mauritius put on cyclone alert 
1216 PORT LOUIS 1996-12-06 
1217 Mauritian authorities put the Indian Ocean island on cyclone alert on Friday 
1218 The weather services office said the centre of the intense tropical cyclone Daniella was 570 km 310 miles north by northwest of the island on Friday afternoon and was moving south by southwest at eight km an hour four knots 
1219 Although not threatening Mauritius directly it is coming closer to the island and could change direction it added 
1220 Winds up to 75 km an hour 40 knots could blow over Mauritius during the night of Friday to Saturday it said 
1221 The weather in the capital Port Louis was heavily cloudy on Friday afternoon with occasional showers

1227 Senegal proposes foreign minister for U.N. post 
1228 DAKAR 1996-12-06 
1229 Senegal 's President Abdou Diouf said on Friday he was proposing his foreign minister Moustapha Niasse for the post of United Nations secretary-general 
1230 Diouf announced his intention to reporters when he returned from the Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso where an African successor to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was discussed 
1231 The United States has vetoed a second term for the Egyptian but left the door open for another African candidate 
1232 If Africa does not wish to lose its turn we have to act fast Diouf said 
1233 Some of my brother heads of state asked me if I would n't nominate Moustapha Niasse 
1234 I see in him the profile of a secretray-general of the United Nations and I have given my endorsement 
1235 Ex-minister son killed in Central Africa unrest 
1236 Raphael Kopessoua 
1237 BANGUI 1996-12-06 
1238 A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui a government minister said on Friday 
1239 With violence spiralling out of control France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers 
1240 France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso 
1241 French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities he said 
1242 Public Service Minister David Dofara who is the head of the national Red Cross told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son who was not named 
1243 Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 
1244 Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong 
1245 The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital 
1246 The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui 
1247 The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km one mile further away said Dofora and other witnesses 
1248 The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre 
1249 A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged 
1250 Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse 's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands 
1251 Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui which is patrolled by French troops with tanks is deserted 
1252 Shops and businesses have remained shut this week 
1253 The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war 
1254 Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui in the coming hours with the heads of state of Gabon Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels 
1255 The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit 
1256 His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission 
1257 Patasse who won Central Africa 's first multi-party elections refuses to resign 
1258 Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure 
1259 Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising 
1260 Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre 
1261 Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad 
1262 Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos 
1263 Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes 
1264 An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups 
1265 In Thursday 's fighting French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre

1284 Albanian jailed for threat of bomb suicide 
1285 TIRANA 1996-12-06 
1286 An Albanian court on Friday sentenced a man who threatened to blow himself up outside President Sali Berisha 's office to 13 years in jail for guerrilla action and illegal possession of arms 
1287 Buza last April said he would blow himself up outside the presidential palace unless he was allowed to speak to Berisha who was at the time meeting Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
1288 Buza was overpowered by riot police less than one hour after he began his action 
1289 Evaluating all the conditions of the case the court thinks the sentence should be lower than the minimum 15 years Tirana judge Qazim Gjonaj added 
1290 The defendant denied the charges saying his action was intended to urge the authorities to give him a $ 20,000 loan 
1291 Medical experts had concluded Buza was mentally unstable but fully responsible for the act he had committed Gjonaj said

1294 Poland 's ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski is likely to visit Polish-born Pope John Paul in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the Vatican and Warsaw the foreign minister said on Friday 
1295 President Kwasniewski plans to visit Italy on a invitation from President Oscar Scalfaro 
1296 A meeting with the Pope is also planned Dariusz Rosati told a news conference 
1297 Rosati said that the atmosphere of the meeting if it takes place would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between Warsaw and the Vatican 
1298 @ 
1299 The ratification of the treaty which was signed in 1993 by the then right-centrist government is being delayed by an ex-communist party which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament 
1300 The party the Democratic Left Alliance says the agreement would give the Catholic Church too much influence over life in Poland and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and non-believers 
1301 The relations with the Vatican have also been soured by a recent relaxation of Poland 's anti-abortion rules which Kwasniewski signed into law last month 
1302 Russia warns Norilsk not expected to liquidate it

1304 MOSCOW 1996-12-06 
1305 Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen 
1306 Norilsk really is a big debtor both to the federal and regional budgets said Konstantin Chernyshev equities analyst at Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher 
1307 Livshits 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company 
1308 The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group 
1309 If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue then it obviously means something said Christopher Granville chief economist at United City Bank in Moscow 
1310 But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded then it was the only answer he could have given 
1311 Russian tax and cabinet authorities under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion three-year loan to Moscow have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation 
1312 They could freeze metal but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget Chernyshev said 
1313 I do n't think they would do that 
1314 Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company and Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk 's debts 
1315 Norilsk officials declined to comment 
1316 Analysts said the government while anxious about Norilsk 's debts is highly unlikely to bring the nickel copper cobalt platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output 
1317 But it also wants Norilsk the world 's second-largest nickel producer to clean up its act 
1318 The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk 
1319 It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears which in the past have led to worker strikes 
1320 It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term the company will remain a debtor in the near future Chernyshev said 
1321 He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money 
1322 Norilsk 's new majority shareholder Russian commerical bank Uneximbank has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues 
1323 But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk 's situation 
1324 Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen said one metals source 
1325 Norilsk said in September that it total debts including unpaid salaries to workers were 13 trillion roubles 
1326 The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets

1337 MOSCOW 1996-12-06 
1338 Russia said on Friday it expected a constructive relationship with Madeleine Albright nominated by U.S. President Bill Clinton to be Secretary of State 
1339 Interfax news agency quoted First Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov as saying Moscow was ready for most active and constructive work with Albright

1342 Our countries leaders have agreed to meet in March 1997 
1343 The Russian foreign ministry believes the new directions in the development of Russian-U.S. relations will be worked out there Ivanov told Interfax 
1344 Interfax outlining Albright 's biography pointed out that she had defended Washington 's interests fiercely as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and that this had included actively supporting NATO 's plans to expand eastwards 
1345 Russia opposes NATO 's plans to take in countries of eastern and central Europe which used to be part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact saying such moves would threaten its security

1350 He told me that he had lost 20 kg 44 lbs which is natural after such an operation 
1351 December 25 a normal working day in Russia is the fifth anniversary of Yeltsin 's arrival in the Kremlin 
1352 He took over there and took control of the red button controlling nuclear arms in December 1991 when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned marking the end of the Soviet Union 
1353 Yeltsin has been shown a few times on television since his quintuple bypass on November 5 but has yet to deliver any major television or radio address to the nation 
1354 Surgeon Renat Akchurin who led the operation told Itar-Tass news agency Yeltsin was working up to four hours a day at his residence 
1355 Bomb explodes outside home of expelled Slovak MP 
1356 BRATISLAVA 1996-12-06 
1357 A bomb exploded on Friday outside the home of a Slovak politician expelled from parliament after he quit the ruling party complaining of a lack of democracy in the country 
1358 The official TASR news agency said the explosion blew out all ground floor windows of Frantisek Gaulieder 's family home in Galanta western Slovakia and damaged the main entrance but no-one was injured 
1359 Gaulieder formerly a member of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 's ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia was stripped of his parliamentary mandate on Wednesday after leaving the party last month in protest over what he said was a lack of democracy in the country 
1360 He said he had been receiving anonymous death threats since making the move 
1361 This was an act of terrorism and now I fear not only for my own life but also of that of my wife and children he told TASR 
1362 Gaulieder 's family was sleeping in a bedroom at the back of the house and were unharmed by the blast 
1363 It was not immediately clear who was behind the blast

1367 Violent crime has soared since the collapse of communism in 1989 as Bulgaria moves to a market economy 
1368 Bombings are often carried out by criminals to settle scores but the motive in this case was not immediately clear

1382 Mexico stocks off lows but still hit by Greenspan 
1383 MEXICO CITY 
1384 Mexican stocks closed sharply lower Friday but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated 
1385 It was Greenspan at first 
1386 Then once we saw the Dow Jones industrial average was not about to crash some buyers stepped in said a trader referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan whose comments that assets were irrationally exhuberant upset financial markets worldwide 
1387 The blue-chip IPC index ended down 1.29 points or 43.56 percent at 3,333.05 
1388 Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded 
1389 Mexican stocks were also hurt by U.S. long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan 's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in Mexico 
1390 Yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in Mexico unchanged from Thursday 
1391 On the broad market 107 stocks changed hands of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13 
1392 Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers 
1393 Simec the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden Sidek group headed the losers off 7 centavos 1 cent at 1.40 pesos 18 cents 
1394 Sidek fell 4 centavos 1 cent to 95 centavos 12 cents 
1395 Traders also remarked that Mexican ADRs suffered in New York 
1396 Heavyweights Telmex and Televisa ended off 25 cents and 75 cents respectively at $ 31.125 and $ 25.875 
1397 Falling share prices in New York do n't hurt Mexico as long as it happens gradually as earlier this week 
1398 It 's a sudden plunge that takes its toll said Carlos Ponce research director at Santander 
1399 Traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on Friday was 
1400 Some buyers stepped in but the market was not very convinced 
1401 Volume was lackluster said one trader 
1402 The market 's very healthy we 're buying said another trader 
1403 Ponce said shares were certainly attractively priced in Mexico but would not appreciate until foreign buyers stepped in which they had yet to do 
1404 Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil 
1405 Simona de Logu 
1406 RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 
1407 Plastic surgery is booming especially among men as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday 
1408 The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 Farid Hakme the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society SBCP said 
1409 The number of operations on men increased even more by 80 percent from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 he said 
1410 Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons the number of patients number of operations number of conferences 
1411 Our statistics are the highest for everything Hakme said 
1412 We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market 
1413 People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy 
1414 A controlled exchange rate trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation making more money available for cosmetic surgery 
1415 Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons Ivo Pitangy 
1416 There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP 
1417 Every year 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there 
1418 Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races which can create physical disharmonies 
1419 What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs he said 
1420 Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each 
1421 Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants 
1422 The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said 
1423 Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country 
1424 Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent 
1425 Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now

1460 Chile Mexico to seek to broaden trade deal 
1461 SANTIAGO 1996-12-05 
1462 Chile and Mexico will start negotiations next year to broaden their free trade agreement to include services and investments Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said 
1463 Chile hopes to broaden the treaty signed in 1994 beyond reduction of tariffs on imports and exports and add provisions covering services and investment codes said Aninat 
1464 Both areas tend to more laden with friction in free trade negotiations than tariff reduction 
1465 In January or February we 'll have some very close contacts with Mexico to add the issue of services and advance on the issue of investments Aninat told reporters after signing a free trade deal with Canada 
1466 We want to give the treaty between Mexico and Chile greater depth and coverage than it has now 
1467 It 's very good now but it practically only covers trade in goods he said 
1468 Aninat also said he was confident the Chilean Congress would ratify the treaty with Congress quickly 
1469 The reactions from business and unions which I have seen have been almost unanimously positive so I do n't see any problem he said

1471 Indonesia 's Belo leaves for Nobel award ceremony 
1472 DILI East Timor 1996-12-06 
1473 East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize 
1474 Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people 
1475 It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo 
1476 The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta who lives in self-exile in Australia 
1477 The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital 
1478 I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta 
1479 will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution to East Timor Alatas said on Friday 
1480 He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference OIC in Jakarta 
1481 Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta 's rule in the territory 
1482 Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year 
1483 The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta 's move 
1484 Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo 
1485 Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved Alatas replied Probably yes but that is a hypothetical question 
1486 Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn 
1487 Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor 's official visit to Indonesia last month but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta

1495 Government disperses protest with water cannons 
1496 RANGOON 1996-12-07 
1497 Burmese troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the Ranyon Rangoon University early on Saturday witnesses said 
1498 They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up 
1499 The students who had staged an 11-hour protest at the junction in northern Rangoon were taken away in three vehicles 
1500 The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the Insein prison in suburban Rangoon 
1501 The protesting students mostly from Rangoon University were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail 
1502 They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon 
1503 The protest was the second major one in five days in the capital 
1504 Burmese students march briefly out of campus

1506 RANGOON 1996-12-06 
1507 About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km four miles away and returned to their campus witnesses said 
1508 Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute 
1509 There were no clashes 
1510 They are now back in the YIT campus an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone 
1511 One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities 
1512 But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus witnesses said 
1513 They were singing peacefully 
1514 On Monday and Tuesday students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October 
1515 On Tuesday and Wednesday opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests 
1516 She was allowed to move freely on Thursday 
1517 The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon 
1518 The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising 
1519 Thousands were killed or imprisoned 
1520 Earlier on Friday some of the students who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week said they were still dissatisfied with the military government 
1521 They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council SLORC had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus 
1522 We still want government answers to our demands 
1523 We want police punishment to be published in newspapers one student said 
1524 But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy NLD 
1525 Suu Kyi a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students 
1526 But they have said both parties had a moral link in that they were against police brutality and injustice 
1527 The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October 
1528 The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration 
1529 The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising 
1530 On Friday the road leading to Suu Kyi 's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police 
1531 Union leaders outraged by WTO snub to ILO head 
1532 SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 
1533 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ILO had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in Singapore 
1534 Bill Jordan general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ICFTU told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world 
1535 Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation WTO officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links 
1536 It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded to the pressure in silencing him Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade 
1537 The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda 
1538 Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour 
1539 The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour end discrimination in hiring and guarantee the right to join a union 
1540 Bill Brett chairman of the ILO Workers Group told Reuters before the news conference he was not too surprised but very disappointed that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn 
1541 Some governments are very determined to stop the issue of trade and labour rights being discussed he said adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda 
1542 ASEAN groups Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam 
1543 The ILO wants a trade and labour rights social clause included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering 
1544 Speaking to ICFTU delegates Richard Eglin director of the WTO secretariat said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems 
1545 But he said the WTO 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO 
1546 Indian rubber demand seen outstripping production 
1547 SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 
1548 Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April March season and the trend will persist way into the next century the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday 
1549 K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes a gap of 31,000 tonnes 
1550 For synthetic rubber production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes Matthew added 
1551 Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully the demand-supply gap is expected to widen he said 
1552 Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes 
1553 Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 
1554 Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes 
1555 In 2010/11 domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes 
1556 One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India 
1557 The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber he said

1559 Japan 's authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar 
1560 George Nishiyama 
1561 TOKYO 1996-12-06 
1562 Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels market sources said on Friday 
1563 In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan BOJ governor Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further immediate fall in the yen 
1564 This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara a high-ranking Finance Ministry official who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen 
1565 But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar dealers said 
1566 I think his views on U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar said Hank Note chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank 
1567 Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar 
1568 It 's a strong dollar not stronger 
1569 In that sense the comments are not pointing to a certain direction he said 
1570 It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either said Sumitomo 's Note 
1571 Takao Sakoh first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo said Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable to Sakakibara but it may be okay at the current level at the lower end of 112 yen 
1572 Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply 
1573 He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought 
1574 Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the Sakakibara ceiling for the dollar following the remark 
1575 Adding to the comments by Mr Yen as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark 
1576 The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun 
1577 The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen past 115 yen said Yasuhito Kawashima chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co 
1578 Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan 's economy 
1579 There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen 
1580 The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy said Taisuke Tanaka market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo 
1581 Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets views on the economy have been too negative 
1582 I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday 
1583 The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent 
1584 Lebanon sentences pro-Israeli warlord to death 
1585 Haitham Haddadin 
1586 BEIRUT 1996-12-06 
1587 A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges 
1588 The court convicted General Antoine Lahd head of the South Lebanon Army SLA of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war 
1589 Lahd a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel 
1590 Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state 
1591 He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit 
1592 The charges against Lahd were forming a hostile army carrying weapons on Israel 's side helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence forming an armed gang killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods 
1593 Shortly before Lahd 's trial began a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel 
1594 No date has been set for the trial of the men all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon 
1595 Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies 
1596 Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace 
1597 But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd 
1598 Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres calling Lahd a great Lebanese patriot said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges 
1599 Peres who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders 
1600 The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars a small rightwing Christian civil war militia 
1601 Saqr whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's was convicted of contacting the Israeli enemy passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon

1658 14 years later Florida man dies for killing 
1659 TALLAHASSEE Fla. 1996-12-06 
1660 Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 John Mills Jr 
1661 41 was put to death in Florida 's electric chair Friday 
1662 As Glenn Lawhon a rural Florida minister who is the victim 's father looked on Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST 1213 GMT for the murder of Lester Lawhon 
1663 Speaking in Arabic Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris who was present at the execution 
1664 I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God he quoted Mills as saying 
1665 Prison officials said they had no record of Mills official conversion but they said that on May 14 1991 he had asked that a new name Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed be added to his prison file which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam 
1666 Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty 
1667 Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak fried potatoes and orange juice offered him 
1668 He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser Morris said 
1669 Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida Supreme Court 
1670 On Thursday the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied his appeal in federal court 
1671 In March 1982 Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on the door of Lester Lawhon 's trailer in an attempt to rob it police said 
1672 Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron 
1673 Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away 
1674 Frederick is serving a 347-year sentence

1695 Man stole pigs tipped strippers gets 10 years 
1696 APPLETON Wis 
1697 1996-12-06 
1698 A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery authorities said Friday 
1699 In sentencing Darrel Voeks 38 to a 10-year prison term on Thursday Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was a thief by habit 
1700 You are self-indulgent 
1701 You are narcissitic Luebke said at the sentencing adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him 
1702 Voeks who was already on probation for prior pig thefts pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children 
1703 But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper 
1704 One stripper said Voeks offered to give her $ 3,000 for breast implant surgery

1803 Half of dog bites provoked says American vet 
1804 CHICAGO 1996-12-06 
1805 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday 
1806 The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year more than half of which are suffered by children 
1807 Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus Ohio told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association 
1808 Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them 
1809 Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction 
1810 Let 's respect their territories he said 
1811 Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children 
1812 He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed 
1813 Don Rieck president of the National Animal Control Association said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female 
1814 The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows Rottweilers German shepherds cocker spaniels and Dalmatians 
1815 The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique 
1816 Speaking strictly of dogs 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman 
1817 Today Rottweilers are on the way up Rieck said 
1818 If approached by a stray dog children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck elbows in and gaze forward until the dog goes away

1836 Four Africans said to vie for top U.N. post 
1837 Evelyn Leopold 
1838 UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06 
1839 Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election 
1840 The nominees according to diplomats are Kofi Annan of Ghana the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference 
1841 Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana the Ivory Coast Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing the envoys said 
1842 It was not known if other candidates would step forward 
1843 Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90 was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country 
1844 Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race 
1845 His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse 
1846 The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him 
1847 The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee 
1848 The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali 's term expires

1890 The BJP backs a hardline Hindu campaign to build a temple at the site of the mosque which Hindus believe was the birthplace of the Lord Rama

1950 STEPHENVILLE Newfoundland 1996-12-06 
1951 Two people were killed when an executive jet en route to Ireland from Michigan crashed on approach to an airport in Stephenville Newfoundland on Friday authorities said 
1952 The pilot and co-pilot the only two aboard were killed in the crash of the Learjet 36 airport manager David Snow said in a telephone interview 
1953 Snow said the plane last reported to air traffic control at about 3 A.M. local time 1:30 A.M. EST 0630 GMT when it began its final approach about 10 miles 16 km from the airport in this east coast Canadian province 
1954 That was the last communication the aircraft made with the airport he added 
1955 We considered it as being missing until about 0600 4:30 A.M. EST 0930 GMT 
1956 That 's when the wreckage was discovered Snow said 
1957 He said the cargo flight originated in Grand Rapids Michigan and was due to stop at Stephenville for refueling before going to Shannon Ireland

1960 PLO says Arafat Netanyahu could meet Saturday 
1961 JERUSALEM 1996-12-06 
1962 PLO negotiators said on Friday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel 's handover of Hebron to the PLO 
1963 It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo on Saturday 
1964 There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak one PLO official who requested anonymity told Reuters 
1965 Israeli officials said no meeting had yet been set 
1966 Arafat 's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said 
1967 President Arafat is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet 
1968 President Arafat 's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results 
1969 Especially since the Hebron issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved 
1970 But Rdainah said Arafat would go to Cairo on Saturday for talks with Mubarak 
1971 Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet 
1972 They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis 
1973 The violence was spurred by Israel 's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem 
1974 The Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of Hebron to PLO rule had been meaningless necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting 
1975 Mubarak 's adviser Osama el-Baz said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders 
1976 Palestinian Authority Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo either on Friday or Sunday 
1977 Abdel-Rahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath 
1978 But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance 
1979 Turkey hindered by own landmines on Syrian border 
1980 ANKARA 1996-12-06 
1981 Turkey 's efforts to prevent Kurdish rebels and smugglers infiltrating from Syria are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border a commission of parliamentarians said 
1982 It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown because a minefield chart cannot be found the commission said in a report on border protection 
1983 The report to be debated in parliament in coming weeks was seen by Reuters on Friday 
1984 Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces it said 
1985 It said Kurdistan Workers Party PKK guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces 
1986 Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas 
1987 They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle it said 
1988 An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment 
1989 Turkey says Syria sponsors the PKK fighting for Kurdish self-rule in southeast Turkey 
1990 Damascus denies aiding the rebels 
1991 The PKK also crosses into Turkey from bases in the mountains of northern Iraq 
1992 More than 21,000 people have died in the 12-year-old conflict 
1993 Three dead in Kurd militia blood feud in Turkey 
1994 DIYARBAKIR Turkey 1996-12-06 
1995 Three people were killed on Friday in a gun battle between rival groups of anti-guerrilla militiamen on the streets of this southeastern Turkish city police said 
1996 Four others were wounded in the clash caused by a blood feud between two families the Kesers and Karabuluts serving as state-paid village guards against Kurdish rebels 
1997 Police said the guards fired automatic weapons at each other 
1998 One of the dead was a civilian passer-by 
1999 The role of the 70,000 mainly Kurdish village guards who fight Kurdistan Workers Party PKK guerrillas in the southeast has been questioned recently after media allegations that many of them are involved in common crime 
2000 The head of the region 's main pro-state militia is at the centre of a security scandal that has shaken the government 
2001 More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict between Turkish security forces and the PKK fighting for Kurdish autonomy or independence

2048 U.S. blasts release of convicted bomber 
2049 WASHINGTON 1996-12-05 
2050 The United States Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 saying the move does not make sense 
2051 All of us who have been victimised by terrorists need to stand together against terrorists 
2052 We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said 
2053 Mohammed Rashid is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars 
2054 It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence This is an incomprehensible move 
2055 It does not make sense Burns told a news briefing 
2056 He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years 
2057 The Clinton administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government Burns said 
2058 Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters 
2059 Rashid 46 was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982 
2060 His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 
2061 A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece 
2062 The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim 
2063 Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial held at Korydallos prison said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four U.S. citizens 
2064 School football player banned for slashing opponents 
2065 ALBUQUERQUE N.M. 1996-12-05 
2066 A New Mexico high school football player who used razor-sharp helmet buckles to slash opponents and a referee was expelled from high school banned Thursday from competition for one year 
2067 Mike Cito 17 was expelled from St Pius X High School in Albuquerque after an October game in which he used the sharpened chin strap buckles to injure two opposing players and the referee 
2068 One of the players need 10 stitches to a cut on his forearm 
2069 Officials said the New Mexico Activities Association decided to bar Cito from any inter-scholastic competition until next October regardless of the school he attends 
2070 Cito 's father Stephen Cito had admitted filing the metal buckles to a fine edge saying he did it to get even with the referee and with players who had roughed up his son in a previous game 
2071 Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks 
2072 Elif Kaban 
2073 GENEVA 1996-12-06 
2074 In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age 
2075 But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether 
2076 After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time 
2077 Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases 
2078 If it goes on like this we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions a frustrated Western delegate said 
2079 They announced they will start evening sessions next week 
2080 Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices 
2081 It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles 
2082 It 's fair use 
2083 We can read sports statistics or stock prices 
2084 But with the treaty this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing said James Love a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology 
2085 None of the treaties are ready to move 
2086 These people do n't understand what they 're doing 
2087 At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry the coming medium for the distribution of music films literature software and commerce 
2088 Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights covered by the century-old Berne Convention 
2089 But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries 
2090 A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet 
2091 Mongolia 's state copyright official Gundegma Jargalshaihan said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda 
2092 We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia he added 
2093 Alexander Bavykin deputy legal chief at Russia 's foreign ministry said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace 
2094 He too had never browsed the Net 
2095 I 've never tried it and why should I ? 
2096 There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either he said 
2097 A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse 
2098 Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway said Marc Pearl vice-president of the Information Technology Association of America a trade association of U.S. network companies opposing the treaties 
2099 But there are a lot of dinosaurs here

2124 Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua where the party has set up its own parliament of the north Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called my friends from the League to work instead for federal reform 
2125 It is an invitation a commitment a promise 
2126 Let 's march together Scalfaro a northerner himself said 
2127 Help Italy to teach to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood 
2128 But turn back from the line you are taking now he said 
2129 Scalfaro was in Mantua to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity

2194 British Euro-sceptic says Clarke should resign 
2195 LONDON 1996-12-06 
2196 A Euro-sceptic member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency 
2197 Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year 
2198 We have a divided and split Cabinet 
2199 This cannot endure Marlow told BBC television 's Newsnight programme on Thursday 
2200 It is not sustainable 
2201 Kenneth Clarke has to go 
2202 If he does n't resign the prime minister has got to fire him 
2203 Marlow 's comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its wait and see policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament 
2204 Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major 
2205 Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership 
2206 His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow pro-European Michael Heseltine deputy prime minister 
2207 Pro-European Conservative MP Edwina Currie told the BBC that if Clarke resigned other ministers would go with him 
2208 Court ejects head of Australian child-sex inquiry 
2209 CANBERRA 1996-12-06 
2210 The Australian opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside 
2211 The court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity even though he still had months of investigation before him 
2212 Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said 
2213 But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry established in May appointing a new head to lead it 
2214 Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash 
2215 Accordingly they demand an open investigation 
2216 A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the appointment of a new inquiry head administrative law expert Pamela O'Neil showed the government 's commitment to pursue the matter

2222 SYDNEY 1996-12-06 
2223 An Australian hitman who went to the wrong house and killed the wrong man was sentenced to 20 years jail on Friday 
2224 Paul Crofts 33 and an accomplice were contracted to shoot a man identified only as Tony in the leg to punish him for his misconduct with a female friend of the contractor the New South Wales Supreme Court was told 
2225 But in February 1993 Leszic Betcher was shot and killed after answering a knock at the door of his Sydney home 
2226 The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house Judge Michael Grove said 
2227 In sentencing Crofts who pleaded guilty Grove took into account his mildly retarded intellectual state which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population 
2228 Grove said Betcher was not only the victim of a horrendous crime but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices 
2229 The unnamed accomplice was earlier sentenced to 20 years in prison

2313 Bre-X Barrick said to continue Busang talks 
2314 K.T. Arasu 
2315 JAKARTA 1996-12-06 
2316 Canada 's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia sources close to the talks said on Friday 
2317 The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta one source speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters 
2318 Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations 
2319 Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan 
2320 The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold 
2321 The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold 
2322 Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline the source said 
2323 He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang 's central region which might take up to two years 
2324 The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick 
2325 This is a huge project 
2326 we are not selling furniture and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to the source said 
2327 While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out he added 
2328 The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal 
2329 The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property 
2330 As far as I am aware there 's been no new deadline the source said 
2331 The Ministry 's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property 
2332 The government also wants 10 percent of the property 
2333 Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies 
2334 He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find 
2335 Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto 's eldest son Sigit Harjojudanto under which Panutan would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang 's richest parts 
2336 Barrick has teamed up with a construction company in the Citra Group of Suharto 's eldest daughter Siti Hardianti Rukmana in what Barrick had said was a partnership to prepare us for a potential mining development project

2342 FEATURE Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO 
2343 Ramthan Hussain 
2344 SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 
2345 Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation WTO 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade the lifeblood of its economy analysts said 
2346 As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO said Desmond Supple economist at research house I.D.E.A 
2347 Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product 
2348 The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 
2349 In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered 
2350 That would have meant Geneva 
2351 But Singapore had the support of other WTO members 
2352 Derek da Cunha senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ISEAS said Singapore 's hosting of the conference carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe 
2353 There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy but more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market said Tan Kong Yam head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore 
2354 At the ministerial meeting trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT 
2355 In June the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector 
2356 Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks 
2357 There is tension at every step of the way since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights he said 
2358 Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore however this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region 
2359 From a commercial point of view the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry Tan said 
2360 A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues Tan said 
2361 But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy 
2362 Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting ahead of a general election due by April 1997 would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda 
2363 If there are any movements toward freer trade then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain he said 
2364 But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this 
2365 I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed 
2366 Japan NTT says hopes to start int'l business soon 
2367 TOKYO 1996-12-06 
2368 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp NTT said on Friday that it hopes to move into the international telecommunications business as soon as possible following the government 's decision to split NTT into three firms under a holding company

2636 CRICKET WOOLMER MAKES SENTIMENTAL RETURN TO KANPUR 
2637 KANPUR India 1996-12-07 
2638 South Africa 's trip to Kanpur for the third test against India has given former England test cricketer Bob Woolmer the chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace 
2639 Woolmer was born in the northern city of Kanpur when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer 
2640 It 's been a sentimental journey 
2641 A visit to India is always an intriguing experience Woolmer now the South African coach said on Saturday 
2642 Woolmer 48 played 19 tests for England between 1975 and 1981 
2643 His first cricketing sojurn to India was as a member of Tony Greig 's England side in 1976-77 
2644 His father Clarence Woolmer represented United Province now renamed Uttar Pradesh in India 's Ranji Trophy national championship and captained the state during 1949 
2645 Now aged 86 Woolmer senior lives with his son in Cape Town 
2646 Woolmer 's memories of Kanpur are few and blurred 
2647 I do n't remember much of the place he said 
2648 I came here on zero and left at three aged three when my father was transferred to Calcutta where I spent another four and half years 
2649 But I do remember we had a cobra snake in the basement of our house 
2650 Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two 
2651 Woolmer said the hospital where he was born is close to the stadium where the India-South Africa test will be played

2762 ALPINE SKIING-OFFICIALS HOPE TO SALVAGE WORLD CUP WEEKEND 
2763 WHISTLER British Columbia 1996-12-06 
2764 World Cup ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme 
2765 For the third consecutive day Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler Mountain leaving the scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy 
2766 Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged 
2767 Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning conditions permitting and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday 
2768 There was no possibility today to make a training run said Bernd Zobel the Canadian men 's national coach citing too much new snow and poor visibility 
2769 If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned

2853 RUGBY UNION RETIRING CAMPESE WEIGHS UP OPTIONS 
2854 LONDON 1996-12-07 
2855 David Campese will consider offers to play club rugby in England but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in Australia 
2856 The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a Wallaby jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match London side Saracens who have already snapped up Francois Pienaar Michael Lynagh and Philippe Sella 
2857 If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business said Campese 
2858 I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home 
2859 I 've also got a contract to play for New South Wales in the Super 12 next year 
2860 Former Wallaby captain Nick Farr-Jones believes Campese may yet be tempted to England 
2861 I 'm sure there are a few people in England who 'd be delighted to have David Campese in their club 's jersey he said

3122 LONDON 1996-12-07

3126 The touring team were 27-0 ahead by half-time before easing up in the second-half 
3127 Full-back Matthew Burke finished with a personal haul of 24 points to take his tour aggregate to 136

3158 SOCCER REINSTATED ALBANIA NAMES SQUAD TO PLAY N.IRELAND 
3159 TIRANA 1996-12-07 
3160 Albanian coach Astrit Hafizi said on Saturday it was important that his players brush aside the country 's short ban by FIFA in order to concentrate on next Saturday'sWorld Cup group nine qualifier against Northern Ireland 
3161 World soccer 's governing body reinstated Albania last Tuesday after the Balkan country 's government lifted suspensions on various soccer officials 
3162 FIFA had banned Albania indefinitely after its sports ministry had ordered the suspension of Albanian Football Association general secretary Eduard Dervishi and dissolved the executive committee 
3163 We would be very happy with a draw in Belfast said Hafizi 
3164 Especially if one takes into consideration our difficult post-suspension situation and the fact Northern Ireland is very keen to win 
3165 Regular defender Artur Lekbello who is injured was missing from Hafizi 's squad named on Saturday for the Belfast match

3186 ABU DHABI 1996-12-07 
3187 South Korea made virtually certain of an Asian Cup quarter-final spot with a 4-2 win over Indonesia in a Group A match on Saturday 
3188 After going four up in the first 55 minutes South Korea allowed Indonesia newcomers to Asian Cup finals back into the match conceding two goals from rare counter attacks 
3189 Kim Do Hoon opened the scoring for South Korea in only the fifth minute turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner 
3190 It looked like turning into a rout as Hwang Sun Hong rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the Koreans continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval 
3191 But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute 
3192 The Koreans then appeared to relax allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match 
3193 Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out 
3194 With 65 minutes gone Indonesia 's Widodo Putra who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday was again on target breaking through the Korean defence to beat the keeper with a low shot 
3195 Indonesian keeper Hendro Kartiko produced a string of fine saves to prevent the Koreans increasing their lead

3380 NEW YORK 1996-12-06 
3381 Vancouver Canucks star right wing Pavel Bure was suspended for one game by the National Hockey League and fined $ 1,000 Friday for his hit on Buffalo Sabres defenceman Garry Galley on Wednesday 
3382 Bure received a double-minor penalty for high-sticking with 2:22 left in the first period of Wednesday 's 7-6 overtime win by Vancouver after colliding with Galley in Buffalo zone 
3383 Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to the game 
3384 Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out the suspension 
3385 Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr Bure 's actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent there can be no excuse for this type of conduct Burke said 
3386 Bure who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games will miss Saturday 's home game against Ottawa

3443 Jack Charlton 's relationship with the people of Ireland was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman was officially declared one of their own 
3444 Charlton 61 and his wife Peggy became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton 's achievements as the national soccer manager 
3445 The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life 
3446 It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great great friends in Ireland 
3447 That is why this is so emotional a night for me Charlton said 
3448 It was the joy that we all had over the period that I shared with people that I grew to love that I treasure most he added 
3449 Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995
